      "\t\t\t\t\t<p>High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of advanced metallic materials that have received significant attention in recent years due to their stable microstructures and promising properties.</p>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<p>They are characterized by their peculiar mixing of five or more principal elements in equimolar concentrations. It has been argued that HEAs exhibit high configurational entropy features that arise from compositionally complex mixing, which enable them to stabilize a single-phase solid solution structure. Owing to the solid solution phase formations, these alloys have shown immense structural properties, including excellent strength and fracture toughness, which make them potential candidates for extreme environmental conditions. Surface modification allows the possibility of combining bulk properties of the substrate with the tailored capabilities of coatings, thereby creating a new range of possibilities. Smart functional coatings incorporating new functionalities and coherent responses have surpassed the traditional capabilities of coatings and have taken surface technologies to new heights. Presently, the potential benefits of HEAs are being extended to development of coatings via thermal spraying. The exploration of high entropy alloys in conjunction with thermal spraying techniques to address numerous challenges in extreme engineering environments is still in their early stage of development. Only a few studies were attempted to develop thermal-sprayed HEA coatings to protect against wear and corrosion. However, limited, if any, studies on functional properties such as thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties of thermal sprayed HEA coatings have been pursued.</p>\n",

The second aspect of this work revolves around studying the solid particle erosion properties of these coatings.</p>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<p>The goal of this study was to develop novel AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA compositions to understand how tungsten (W) and vanadium (V) additions in AlCoCrFeMo influence the evolution of microstructures, phase formations, microhardness, electrical resistivity and solid particle erosion properties.</p>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<p>A cost-effective flame spray technique was utilized to produce three different equiatomic AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW, and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings on stainless steel substrates.</p>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<p>To avoid conductivity and short-circuiting during Joule heating experiments, an insulating layer of alumina was deposited on to the substrates before coating depositions. The coatings were characterized using XRD and SEM. The Vickers microhardness technique was used to quantify hardness. A custom assembly was used to determine the electrical resistivity and analyze the Joule heating performance of the coatings. The Joule heating performance was compared on the basis of the rate of increase in surface temperature for a given power input. Solid particle erosion studies were performed using a modified version of the ASTM G-76 standard with a low-pressure cold spray unit, using garnet sand as the erodent and the surface morphology was studied.</p>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<p>The microstructure of the HEA coatings showed the presence of multiple oxide regions along with solid-solution phases. The HEA coatings had an average thickness of approximately <ref type=\"bibr\">153 ± 14 μm</ref> with porosity between 2 to 3%. High hardness values were recorded for all coatings with AlCoCrFeMoV showing the highest hardness. The electrical resistivity values were higher for all the HEA coatings compared to flame-sprayed Ni-20Cr and NiCrAlY coatings and AlCoCrFeNi HEA thin film, which may be attributed to the characteristics of HEAs, such as severe lattice distortion and solute segregations. The coatings have shown improved Joule heating performance when compared with conventional Ni-20Cr flame-sprayed coatings, as indicated by the higher rate of increase in surface temperature for a given power input. Solid particle erosion studies indicated that the coatings underwent a brittle mode of failure. The erosion rate of all three coatings was found to be independent of temperature on testing up to 250 °C. It was statistically determined that AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW coatings have better solid particle erosion resistance than the AlCoCrFeMoV coatings. The erosion rate of the coatings was found to be linearly dependent on the H⁄E (elastic strain to break) ratio and decreased with increasing value of H⁄E ratio. The combined interaction of high hardness, increased electrical resistivity and improved erosion resistance properties suggests that the flame-sprayed HEA coatings can be used as multi-functional wear-resistant materials for energy generation applications. In the end, I am incredibly grateful to my parents Goutam and Mithu for letting me pursue my dreams, being present for me whenever I needed them, tolerating me and living with my absence from their life. I am obliged to Harshal for bringing joy and statistics to my life and being a constant support.

      "\t\t\t\t<p>For the past two decades, a unique concept of alloy designing by the mixing of multiple principal elements in high concentration has been in vogue. This unconventional form of alloy designing was first explored by the research group of Jien-Wei-Yeh in 2004 who was the first to coin the term high entropy alloy (HEA). According to the original definition proposed by Yeh et al. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">[13]</ref>,\n",
      "\t\t\t\t</p>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<p>HEAs are those which are composed of five or more elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratio with the atomic concentration of each principal element being between 5% and 35%. Around the same time, another research group led by Brian Cantor unaware of the term coined by Yeh independently published their work on equiatomic FeCrMnNiCo referring to it as multicomponent alloys <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b13\">[14]</ref>. Yeh and Cantor are regarded as the founding fathers of this new class of materials and their respective works on CuCoNiCrAlxFe and FeCrMnNiCo (also known as Cantor alloys) HEA compositions and their modifications have been widely studied by researchers.</p>\n",

HEAs have been produced in a variety of forms like castings, sintered powder metallurgy parts, and films. The processing routes can be broadly classified into three groups, namely, the melting and casting route, powder metallurgy route, and deposition techniques. The processing routes are similar for equiatomic and non-equiatomic compositions. Melting and casting techniques, with equilibrium and nonequilibrium cooling rates, have been employed to produce HEAs in the shape of rods, bars, ribbons, and nanoparticles. The popular melt processing techniques include vacuum arc melting, vacuum induction melting, and melt spinning. Mechanical alloying followed by sintering has been the major solid-state processing route to produce sintered products. Sputtering, plasma nitriding, spraying and cladding are the surface modification techniques used to produce thin films and thick layers of HEAs on various substrates. </p>\n",

Expectedly, the expansion of the compositional space alloys will undoubtedly bring about rich opportunities in achieving affluent, diverse microstructures as well as structural and functional properties unseen before.

For AlCoCrFeMo HEA powder the BCC1 phase also has a rich content of V and a lattice parameter of 2.87 Å.

An earlier study by Nair et al. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b151\">[151]</ref> suggested that the higher atomic radius of Mo (0.139 nm) and the medium enthalpy of mix of Mo with the other components might be responsible for the limited solubility in AlCoCrFe BCC structure.

      "\t\t\t\t<p>Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_18\">13</ref> shows the XRD profiles of the flame-sprayed HEA coatings. All coatings show the presence of mixed oxides and BCC phases. This aligns well with the results previously reported by Nair et al. 2022 <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b151\">[151]</ref> in their study of flame-sprayed AlCoCrFeMo HEA. Similar results were also reported by Meghawal et al. for AlCoCrFeNi fabricated via air plasma spraying <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b153\">[153]</ref> and by Patel et al for CoCrFeMnNi high-velocity oxy-fuel coatings <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b154\">[154]</ref>. When the XRD profiles of the HEA coatings (in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_18\">13</ref>.) are compared with those of the HEA powders (in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_17\">12</ref>.) it is noted that the peaks shift to a higher angle in the coatings. This may be attributed to the lattice strains and changes in composition associated with oxide formation <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b151\">[151]</ref>. However, only a minor peak shift is observed in the AlCoCrFeMoW HEA coating when compared to the AlCoCrFeMoW HEA powder. This is probably because of the higher melting point of W compared to the other elements as a result of which it is unable to fuse completely to bring about significant changes. The presence, of unmolten and partially molten particles rich in W, have been observed in the SEM images.  The broadening of peaks in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_18\">13</ref>. is suggestive of the presence of amorphous structures which can be accounted for by the presence of oxides and intermetallics. Quantitative phase analysis by X-Ray (Rietveld -RIR analysis) has confirmed the presence of a notable amount of oxide and intermetallic phases in AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV compositions. The major oxides found for AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoV is a spinel oxide (AB2O4, where A=Fe, B=Co) having a lattice parameter of 8.264 Å and Al2O3. Approximately 24% and 17% of spinel oxides were present in AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoV respectively. However, no presence of spinel oxides was found in AlCoCrFeMoW. Also, the total percentage of oxide formed in AlCoCrFeMoW was 52% and 39% lower as compared to AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoV. The major oxide formed in AlCoCrFeMoW is of ABO4 type which is of monoclinic nature (lattice constants a=4.947, a/b= 0.870, c/b= 0.821) with A, B being Co, W, Fe, or Al. Moreover, a negligible amount of Al2O3 was observed in AlCoCrFeMoW. The results of RIR analysis suggest that W tends to preferentially combine with Co, Al and Mo to form complex intermetallics of cubic nature. V on the other hand preferentially combines with Al and Fe resulting in an intermetallic having a BCC-like structure.</p>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<p>The presence of iron-chromium intermetallic has also been noted in AlCoCrFeMoV. On addition of W and V to AlCoCrFeMo, there is a peak shift happening to the left. The peak has shifted from 2θ = 46° for AlCoCrFeMo to 2θ = 43° for AlCoCrFeMoV and 2θ = 40° for AlCoCrFeMoW. The shift to a lower angle is more pronounced in AlCoCrFeMoW. This shifting is attributed to the lattice strains caused due changes in chemical composition <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b155\">[155]</ref>. The lattice constants calculated are 2.78 Å, 3.18 Å and 2.97 Å for AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW, and AlCoCrFeMoV respectively. Thus, the addition of tungsten with an atomic radius of 0.139 nm which is higher than all other elements in the given composition causes severe lattice distortion which results in straining and an ultimate peak shift.</p>\n",

The alumina layer shows the presence of inter-connected elongated pores and has a significantly higher level of porosity as compared to the HEA coatings.

Higher hardness achieved for the AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings could be attributed to concurrent interactions of BCC phases and intermetallics coupled with the existence of oxide inclusions. Prior studies also reported the influence of hard intermetallic phases on high microhardness values <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b159\">[159]</ref>. In addition, the high misfit of the atomic radius of the constituent elements may contribute to an increase in hardness for the AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings.

In addition, HEAs exhibit transition metals with a high concentration of point defects resulting from multi-principal elements in a pseudo-unitary lattice cell <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b162\">[162,</ref>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b163\">163]</ref>. These intrinsic structural defects induce pronounced scattering of electrons, contributing to higher electrical resistivity for the HEA coatings compared to that of conventional Ni-20Cr coatings. Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_25\">19</ref>. shows the correlation of electrical resistivity with the weight fractions of oxides in HEA coatings. An apparent correlation of Adj. 𝑅 2 = 92% was found between oxides and electrical resistivity as shown in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_25\">19</ref>. This correlation suggests that the evolution of oxides due to oxidation in-flight has a strong dependence on the electrical resistivity of the HEA coatings. AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings exhibited high weight fraction of oxides approximately 70%, followed by AlCoCrFeMoV (~55%) and AlCoCrFeMoW HEA coatings (~30%), respectively. According to literature <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b164\">[164]</ref> transition, metal-based oxides are typically non-stoichiometric compounds, which have been found to follow general behaviour as a semiconductor. Furthermore, all the HEA coatings exhibited a negative temperature coefficient of resistance as shown in Table <ref type=\"table\" target=\"#tab_5\">6</ref>. A negative temperature coefficient of resistance is suggesting the decrease in resistivity of the materials with an increase in temperature. As shown in Table <ref type=\"table\" target=\"#tab_5\">6</ref>, AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings showed the least value approximately 3.82 × 10 -4 °𝐶-1 , which was 102% and 732% lower than that of AlCoCrFeMoV and AlCoCrFeMoW HEA coatings, respectively.

As mentioned previously, the evolution of the high fraction of oxides due to oxidation in-flight acts as a semiconductor, wherein, electrons in the valence band get excited and jump to the conduction band due to an increase in temperature, contributing to a negative temperature coefficient of resistance <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b165\">[165]</ref>.

Hence, as presented in the results, the evolution of oxides and underlying microstructure coupled with topological lattice distortion associated with large atomic size misfit appears to be the primary responsible factor for improvement in electrical resistivity for all the HEA coatings. </p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t<head n=\"3.5.\">Joule Heating Performance</head>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<p>Joule heating, also known as Ohmic or resistive heating, is the generation of heat in a metal as a result of passing electrical current through the metal over a voltage difference. Under free heat convection conditions, heat may be lost from the coating substrate ensemble as a result of fluid movement due to pressure and density gradients in the air. The air velocities near the coatingsubstrate system are low, with the majority of air remaining stagnant. On supplying electrical power, the surface temperatures of the coating increased beyond the ambient temperature due to the generation of heat by Joule heating. The Joule heating performance of the coatings has been compared based on the rate of increase in surface temperature for given power input. Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_26\">20</ref> shows the variation in surface temperature as a function of time during Joule heating of the coatings under free convection. For the purpose of comparison, Ni-20Cr has been utilized in the present investigation. As shown in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_26\">20</ref>, it is apparent that the surface temperatures show a linear dependency on time. A linear regression of 99% was found for all the coatings. The slope of the curve corresponding to the rate of change in temperature was calculated and plotted in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_27\">21</ref>. A more rapid change in the rate of increase in temperature is observed at higher powers. The rate of increase in temperature becomes ten times when the power is increased from 3.5 to 35 and two times when the power is doubled from 35 to 75 W. This is expected as more energy is being delivered to the system at higher powers. It should be noted that all the HEA coatings have a higher rate of increase in surface temperature ranging between 2.5 to 3.3 times that of Ni-20Cr, as observed in the Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_27\">21</ref>. However, the variation in performance between the HEAs themselves is minuscule. The addition of W and V to AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings can result in either an increase in the Joule heating performance up to 2% or a decrease to 9% depending on the power input. At low power of 3.5W, AlCoCrFeMoW HEA coatings have a relatively better (~2%)</p>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<p>performance. This may be because of the lower resistance of AlCoCrFeMoW which allows a larger current to flow resulting in a greater amount of heat generated as given by equation 4. However, when the power increases from 3.5 to 35 W there is a drop in the temperature values for AlCoCrFeMoW after about 10 minutes as seen in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_27\">21</ref>. A similar trend for AlCoCrFeMoW can also be seen after 8 minutes of power being supplied at 75W (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_27\">21</ref>). It is also observed that there is a noticeable increase in the temperature values recorded for AlCoCrFeMoV at 75 W. Local changes in the structure like the formation of quasi-stable atomic clusters at elevated temperatures can lead to a decrease in electrical resistivity which will then allow more current to pass resulting in more heat being generated <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b168\">[168]</ref>. Advanced characterization like in-situ TEM would be required to support the claims. When a similar amount of electrical energy (power) is given to each of the systems, the HEAs can reach a higher maximum temperature as compared to Ni-20Cr. The stark difference in the Joule heating performance and the higher maximum temperatures attained could be attributed to the difference in resistance (resistivity) values observed between the HEAs and Ni-20Cr coatings. Paired t-tests were conducted between the three HEA coatings and Ni-20Cr to identify the material with the best performance. The number of data points analyzed were less than 30 hence, it is assumed that the samples follow the t-distribution thus, justifying the use of the t-statistic for hypothesis testing 2 . To get an accurate comparison between materials and get a better estimation of p-values, resampling is applied to experimental results to increase the sample size for each material to 10. The null hypothesis was chosen as: \"there is no significant difference in Joule heating performance between material 1 and material 2.\" The python code employed to compute the statistics has been included in Appendix. Table <ref type=\"table\" target=\"#tab_6\">7</ref> indicates the p-value for each pair. A p-value (the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed) is lesser than the α value of 0.05 would indicate the presence of a significant difference. It can be seen that the p-value is greater than 0.05 when comparing the three HEA coatings themselves. However, the p-value is lesser than 0.05 when each of the HEA coatings is compared with Ni-20Cr. Thus, we can conclude statistically that all three HEA coatings have a better Joule heating performance than Ni-20Cr but no significant difference in performance between themselves. Hence, other factors like high-temperature properties, fracture, corrosion and fatigue resistance could be investigated to ascertain the best material for the given application. </p>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t<p>The solid particle erosion rates in terms of volume loss of material per unit mass of erodent particle as a function of impact angle for the three flame-sprayed HEA coatings have been shown in Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_6\">23</ref>. Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_5\">22</ref>. is indicative of the difference in the shape of the eroded area obtained at different impact angles. The eroded surface area as expected is elliptical at 30° and circular at 90°. Although the eroded area appears to be large at 30° more volume loss of material i.e., a higher erosion rate has been recorded at an impact angle of 90° as compared to 30°. Erosion rates were 21%, 23 % and 29% lower for AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV respectively at an impact angle of 30° as compared to 90°. This suggests that the coatings undergo a brittle mode of erosion <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b79\">[80]</ref>. Brittle erosion develops in hard materials (such as ceramics) due to the formation of crack networks, and these materials erode quickly at normal incidence ( impact angle =90°) <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b113\">[114]</ref>. The limited number of active slip systems in BCC structures coupled with the complexity of atomic arrangement and difference in the bonding enthalpy of near neighbour atoms in HEA could hinder the movement of dislocations resulting in increased hardness and brittleness <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b136\">[137,</ref>\n",

Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_30\">24</ref>. shows the SEM micrographs of the eroded AlCoCrFeMo HEA coated specimens under the three different testing conditions at low and high magnifications. The eroded surface morphology at an impact angle of 30° has characteristic ploughing marks and lips. The presence of pits, microindents and a few cracks have also been observed. In contrast, the surface eroded at normal incidence (90°) shows the presence of large craters, wide cracks, micro-indents and lips.   The ratio of particle hardness to target hardness is known to have a strong controlling influence on the erosion mechanism. When this ratio is greater than 1 it results in indentation-induced fractures <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b96\">[97]</ref>. This ratio in our case is evidently greater than 1(hardness of sand particle approximately around 1500 to 1700 HV and coatings between 594 to 750 HV) leading to erosion by splat ejection and indentation-induced material removal. The erosion at an oblique impact angle of 30° is dominated by ploughing and cutting. As observed from the eroded surface morphology at oblique impact angles, the surface of the coatings is first cut by the erodent particles due to large horizontal stress to form furrows. The continuous impact of erosion particles then leads to the extrusion of materials to the edge and the formation of lips. The extrusion lip keeps accumulating material and deforming until it is removed from the surface by fracture. At vertical impact angles loss in material occurs due to the constant impact in the form of indents. The erodent particle impacting the surface of the coating at a normal angle result in the formation of microindents and the initiation of cracks. These cracks grow and propagate during subsequent continuous impact leading to the flaking of materials and the formation of craters. Thus, the major erosion mechanism at a vertical angle is dominated by cracking and crater formation <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b79\">[80,</ref>\n",

Evaluation of erosion rate at higher temperatures and high-temperature mechanical properties would be required to corroborate the aforementioned rationale.

Six K-type thermocouples (T1 to T6) (Twidec 3M K-Type Sensor Probe, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215008, CN) were employed to record the surface temperature of the coatings and substrates, as shown in the Fig. 8. A direct current (DC) power supply (1902B DC, B&amp;K Precision Corporation, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) with a maximum voltage and current specification of 60 V and 15 A was employed to generate voltage differences within the heating elements. The data to study the temperature dependence of resistance was collected during self-heating of the samples, i.e., recording the values of flowing currents and the corresponding voltage drops across the resistor when operating as a heater.</figDesc>\n",

Compared to the nanohardness the Vickers microhardness values measured seem to be lower. This was anticipated and can be attributed to the indentation size effect (ISE) because of the relatively low load (5 mN) that was used to measure the nanohardness compared to the higher load (300 gf = 2.94 N) used to measure the Vicker's microhardness. According to the indentation size effect (ISE), the generation of strain fields under the smaller indent areas leads to dislocations that are responsible for higher hardness. The Vicker's microhardness measurement is however provides a better indication of the macroscopic properties as it is a calculated balance of different the different microstructural artefacts like phases, porosity and defects that are characteristics of thermal spray processes. On the other hand, because of the small indent size and precise positioning of the indent in nanoindentation defects have minimal impact on the observed values. It thus provides the hardness values of specific phases. The high variability in the nanoindentation results is because the values depend on the individual phase structure and compositions and positioning of the indent within the microstructure.</figDesc>\n",

A cold gas dynamic spray system (SST Series P, CenterLine Ltd., Windsor, ON, Canada) was used to accelerate the erodent particles at ambient gas temperatures. The operating parameters have been listed in Table <ref type=\"table\">3</ref>. Garnet sand (Super Garnet, V.V. Mineral, Tamil Nadu, India) having an angular morphology and approximate particle diameter of 349 ± 57 µm (n=30) was chosen as the erodent medium. Figure <ref type=\"figure\">10</ref>. shows the SEM micrograph of the sand particles used in the study. The velocity of the erodent particles at the nozzle exit is estimated to be in the range of 65 to 73 m/s <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b97\">[98]</ref> The erosion testing was performed at two different impact angles 30° and 90° at ambient temperature. Erosion tests were also conducted at elevated temperatures and an impact angle of 30° by heating the substrates to 250° C with the help of cartridge heaters (50  AlCoCrFeMoW the splats are thicker and more rounded. Tungsten (W) which has a high melting point of 3695 K when added to AlCoCrFeMo results in incompletely melting of the feedstock powder particles before impacting the substrate and consequently rounder splats. The images at AlCoCrFeMo (~70%) &gt; AlCoCrFeMoV (~55%) &gt; AlCoCrFeMoW (~33%) whereas, the amount of intermetallics follows the trend AlCoCrFeMoW (~48%) &gt; AlCoCrFeMoV (~28%) &gt; AlCoCrFeMo (~12%). Thus, the presence of both oxides and intermetallics in optimal amount might be the reason for the higher strength in AlCoCrFeMoV.

It is anticipated that heat treating the coatings at the ideal temperature for the required amount of time will result in the formation of stable microstructures which will not be further affected by changes in temperature thus leading to stable electrical resistivity. However, it can be time-consuming to figure out the exact heat treatment temperature and duration. Also, the repeated fabrication and heating tests would result in a lot of waste of materials and energy. Hence, advanced machine learning</p>\n",

      "      High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of advanced metallic materials that have received significant attention in recent years due to their stable microstructures and promising properties.\n",

      "     <p>\n",
      "      They are characterized by their peculiar mixing of five or more principal elements in equimolar concentrations. It has been argued that HEAs exhibit high configurational entropy features that arise from compositionally complex mixing, which enable them to stabilize a single-phase solid solution structure. Owing to the solid solution phase formations, these alloys have shown immense structural properties, including excellent strength and fracture toughness, which make them potential candidates for extreme environmental conditions. Surface modification allows the possibility of combining bulk properties of the substrate with the tailored capabilities of coatings, thereby creating a new range of possibilities. Smart functional coatings incorporating new functionalities and coherent responses have surpassed the traditional capabilities of coatings and have taken surface technologies to new heights. Presently, the potential benefits of HEAs are being extended to development of coatings via thermal spraying. The exploration of high entropy alloys in conjunction with thermal spraying techniques to address numerous challenges in extreme engineering environments is still in their early stage of development. Only a few studies were attempted to develop thermal-sprayed HEA coatings to protect against wear and corrosion. However, limited, if any, studies on functional properties such as thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties of thermal sprayed HEA coatings have been pursued.\n",

      "     iii Solid particle erosion is a typical wear mode that negatively impacts the longevity of parts in many sectors like aerospace, marine, mining, wind energy, and oil and gas; thus improving the erosion resistance of the components in this sector is economically important. The second aspect of this work revolves around studying the solid particle erosion properties of these coatings.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     The goal of this study was to develop novel AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA compositions to understand how tungsten (W) and vanadium (V) additions in AlCoCrFeMo influence the evolution of microstructures, phase formations, microhardness, electrical resistivity and solid particle erosion properties.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     A cost-effective flame spray technique was utilized to produce three different equiatomic AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW, and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings on stainless steel substrates.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     To avoid conductivity and short-circuiting during Joule heating experiments, an insulating layer of alumina was deposited on to the substrates before coating depositions. The coatings were characterized using XRD and SEM. The Vickers microhardness technique was used to quantify hardness. A custom assembly was used to determine the electrical resistivity and analyze the Joule heating performance of the coatings. The Joule heating performance was compared on the basis of the rate of increase in surface temperature for a given power input. Solid particle erosion studies were performed using a modified version of the ASTM G-76 standard with a low-pressure cold spray unit, using garnet sand as the erodent and the surface morphology was studied.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     The microstructure of the HEA coatings showed the presence of multiple oxide regions along with solid-solution phases. The HEA coatings had an average thickness of approximately\n",
      "     with porosity between 2 to 3%. High hardness values were recorded for all coatings with AlCoCrFeMoV showing the highest hardness. The electrical resistivity values were higher for all the HEA coatings compared to flame-sprayed Ni-20Cr and NiCrAlY coatings and AlCoCrFeNi HEA thin film, which may be attributed to the characteristics of HEAs, such as severe lattice distortion and solute segregations. The coatings have shown improved Joule heating performance when compared with conventional Ni-20Cr flame-sprayed coatings, as indicated by the higher rate of increase in surface temperature for a given power input. Solid particle erosion studies indicated that the coatings underwent a brittle mode of failure. The erosion rate of all three coatings was found to be independent of temperature on testing up to 250 °C. It was statistically determined that AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW coatings have better solid particle erosion resistance than the AlCoCrFeMoV coatings. The erosion rate of the coatings was found to be linearly dependent on the H⁄E (elastic strain to break) ratio and decreased with increasing value of H⁄E ratio. The combined interaction of high hardness, increased electrical resistivity and improved erosion resistance properties suggests that the flame-sprayed HEA coatings can be used as multi-functional wear-resistant materials for energy generation applications. In the end, I am incredibly grateful to my parents Goutam and Mithu for letting me pursue my dreams, being present for me whenever I needed them, tolerating me and living with my absence from their life. I am obliged to Harshal for bringing joy and statistics to my life and being a constant support. I am so thankful to all my friends for being patient, listening to my cribbing and encouraging me whenever I was low. Lastly, I thank the universe for bringing my kitties-the love of my life, Mota and Luna to my life who made me immensely patient and were always by my side whenever I was sad or lonely.\n",

      "     . In contrast, the BCC HEAs inherently have relatively high intrinsic yield strength because of the limited number of active slip systems\n",
      "     . Moreover, the BCC RHEAs have excellent high-temperature mechanical properties\n",

This rationale for super-had coatings was based on the Archard wear model wherein the wear volume was found to be inversely proportional to the hardness of the softer material in a sliding/adhesive contact. However, super-hard coatings are usually susceptible to brittle fracture. Matthews, Leyland and co-workers have determined that in many practical wear situations hardness alone is not particularly an effective predictor of wear resistance\n",

The Al (0.143 nm), Mo (0.139 nm), W (0.139 nm) and V (0.136 nm) exhibits high atomic radius than Co (0.125nm), Cr (0.128 nm), and Fe (0.126 nm), which facilitate lattice distortion, which eventually may lead to solid-solution strengthening, thus, high hardness. Similar behaviour by the influence of vanadium (V) on both the FCC Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-V and BCC Cr-Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W-Hf-Ti-Zr families of the high-entropy alloy was reported previously by Yin et al.\n",
      "     . They have concluded from their work that the presence of vanadium is the key to high strength in both FCC and BCC high entropy alloys and have attributed this to the uniqueness in the atomic volume of vanadium in both BCC and FCC crystals vis-à-vis larger in FCC and smaller in bcc HEAs\n",

Although the eroded area appears to be large at 30° more volume loss of material i.e., a higher erosion rate has been recorded at an impact angle of 90° as compared to 30°. Erosion rates were 21%, 23 % and 29% lower for AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV respectively at an impact angle of 30° as compared to 90°. This suggests that the coatings undergo a brittle mode of erosion\n",

The eroded surface morphology at an impact angle of 30° has characteristic ploughing marks and lips. The presence of pits, microindents and a few cracks have also been observed. In contrast, the surface eroded at normal incidence (90°) shows the presence of large craters, wide cracks, micro-indents and lips.   The ratio of particle hardness to target hardness is known to have a strong controlling influence on the erosion mechanism. When this ratio is greater than 1 it results in indentation-induced fractures\n",
      "     . This ratio in our case is evidently greater than 1(hardness of sand particle approximately around 1500 to 1700 HV and coatings between 594 to 750 HV) leading to erosion by splat ejection and indentation-induced material removal. The erosion at an oblique impact angle of 30° is dominated by ploughing and cutting. As observed from the eroded surface morphology at oblique impact angles, the surface of the coatings is first cut by the erodent particles due to large horizontal stress to form furrows. The continuous impact of erosion particles then leads to the extrusion of materials to the edge and the formation of lips. The extrusion lip keeps accumulating material and deforming until it is removed from the surface by fracture. At vertical impact angles loss in material occurs due to the constant impact in the form of indents. The erodent particle impacting the surface of the coating at a normal angle result in the formation of microindents and the initiation of cracks. These cracks grow and propagate during subsequent continuous impact leading to the flaking of materials and the formation of craters. Thus, the major erosion mechanism at a vertical angle is dominated by cracking and crater formation\n",

      "     This thesis study explored the feasibility of using flame spraying as a potential manufacturing technique for high entropy alloys coatings. The mechanical and physical properties of the as fabricated flame sprayed coatings were then analyzed for potential multi-functional applications. The major outcomes of the study have been summarized below.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • Novel equiatomic AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings having an approximate thickness of 150 µm were fabricated by flame spraying on 316 L stainless steel substrates.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The microstructure of the HEA coatings was characterized using XRD, SEM and EDS.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     The HEA coatings showed BCC solid solution structures with the presence of mixed oxide regions due to oxidation in-flight.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • Vicker's microhardness tests indicated that the AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings has the highest average hardness followed by AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     Improvement in hardness is due to solid solution strengthening, BCC phases and a high fraction of oxide regions.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • Electrical characterization has shown that the flame sprayed HEA coatings exhibited high resistivity and negative thermal coefficient of resistance because of the large lattice distortions and s-d scattering of electrons.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The Joule heating studies have exhibited that the heating performance of all the three HEA coatings was 2 to 3 times better than that of flame sprayed Ni-20Cr. However, the three HEA coatings themselves showed similar heating performance at ambient temperature and free convection conditions. The improved performance has been attributed to the difference in electrical resistivity observed for Ni-20Cr and the HEA coatings.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The nanoindentation studies showed that AlCoCrFeMo has a higher elastic strain to break-𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio compared to the other two coatings because of its exceptionally lower elastic modulus compared to the other two materials.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • Solid Particle Erosion studies have shown that the rate of erosion for all three HEA coatings depends on the impact angle. A higher rate of erosion was observed at an impact angle of 90° in comparison to 30° suggesting a brittle mode of failure.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The erosion rate of all three coatings was found to be independent of temperature on testing up to 250 °C.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • It was statistically determined that AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW coatings have better solid particle erosion resistance than the AlCoCrFeMoV coatings.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The AlCoCrFeMoV coatings having the highest hardness had the least favourable erosion properties thus high hardness doesn't necessarily imply high erosion resistance. The erosion rate of the coatings was found to be linearly dependent on the 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ (elastic strain to break) ratio and decreased with increasing value of 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     algorithms based on the Monte-Carlo time series approach could be employed to predict the value of stable electrical resistivity and the ideal heat treatment temperature and duration. The train the model it will be fed with the data for the change in resistance with temperatures for ten heating cycles initially for a given coating. The predicted outcomes of the model can then be verified with a subsequent limited number of experimentations.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     In this initial study of the flame sprayed HEA coatings for heating applications the coatings were deposited over rectangular-shaped samples. Electrical components often have complex shapes and patterns. The issue of failure of the complex or patterned coatings at high operating temperatures due to the development of thermal stresses is of great concern from the industrial application point of view\n",
      "     . Thus, studying the fatigue, creep and failure properties of complex/patterned thermal sprayed HEA would be essential to understanding the practical feasibility of the proposed application.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     The high electrical resistivity observed for the flame-sprayed coatings in this work has been attributed to the inherent nature of HEA (i.e., lattice distortion, disorder), the presence of oxides and other microstructural defects like pores. However, the single most significant factor or the relative influence of each of these factors has not been established. To understand the influence of oxides and porosity on the electrical resistivity HEA coatings having different oxide and porosity could be manufactured using different thermal spray techniques like cold spray and HVOF and their properties compared.\n",
