      "      High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of advanced metallic materials that have received significant attention in recent years due to their stable microstructures and promising properties.\n",
      "     </p>\n",
      "     <p>\n",
      "      They are characterized by their peculiar mixing of five or more principal elements in equimolar concentrations. It has been argued that HEAs exhibit high configurational entropy features that arise from compositionally complex mixing, which enable them to stabilize a single-phase solid solution structure. Owing to the solid solution phase formations, these alloys have shown immense structural properties, including excellent strength and fracture toughness, which make them potential candidates for extreme environmental conditions. Surface modification allows the possibility of combining bulk properties of the substrate with the tailored capabilities of coatings, thereby creating a new range of possibilities. Smart functional coatings incorporating new functionalities and coherent responses have surpassed the traditional capabilities of coatings and have taken surface technologies to new heights. Presently, the potential benefits of HEAs are being extended to development of coatings via thermal spraying. The exploration of high entropy alloys in conjunction with thermal spraying techniques to address numerous challenges in extreme engineering environments is still in their early stage of development. Only a few studies were attempted to develop thermal-sprayed HEA coatings to protect against wear and corrosion. However, limited, if any, studies on functional properties such as thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties of thermal sprayed HEA coatings have been pursued.\n",

      "     iii Solid particle erosion is a typical wear mode that negatively impacts the longevity of parts in many sectors like aerospace, marine, mining, wind energy, and oil and gas; thus improving the erosion resistance of the components in this sector is economically important. The second aspect of this work revolves around studying the solid particle erosion properties of these coatings.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     The goal of this study was to develop novel AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA compositions to understand how tungsten (W) and vanadium (V) additions in AlCoCrFeMo influence the evolution of microstructures, phase formations, microhardness, electrical resistivity and solid particle erosion properties.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     A cost-effective flame spray technique was utilized to produce three different equiatomic AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW, and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings on stainless steel substrates.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     To avoid conductivity and short-circuiting during Joule heating experiments, an insulating layer of alumina was deposited on to the substrates before coating depositions. The coatings were characterized using XRD and SEM. The Vickers microhardness technique was used to quantify hardness. A custom assembly was used to determine the electrical resistivity and analyze the Joule heating performance of the coatings. The Joule heating performance was compared on the basis of the rate of increase in surface temperature for a given power input. Solid particle erosion studies were performed using a modified version of the ASTM G-76 standard with a low-pressure cold spray unit, using garnet sand as the erodent and the surface morphology was studied.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     The microstructure of the HEA coatings showed the presence of multiple oxide regions along with solid-solution phases. The HEA coatings had an average thickness of approximately\n",
      "     with porosity between 2 to 3%. High hardness values were recorded for all coatings with AlCoCrFeMoV showing the highest hardness. The electrical resistivity values were higher for all the HEA coatings compared to flame-sprayed Ni-20Cr and NiCrAlY coatings and AlCoCrFeNi HEA thin film, which may be attributed to the characteristics of HEAs, such as severe lattice distortion and solute segregations. The coatings have shown improved Joule heating performance when compared with conventional Ni-20Cr flame-sprayed coatings, as indicated by the higher rate of increase in surface temperature for a given power input. Solid particle erosion studies indicated that the coatings underwent a brittle mode of failure. The erosion rate of all three coatings was found to be independent of temperature on testing up to 250 °C. It was statistically determined that AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW coatings have better solid particle erosion resistance than the AlCoCrFeMoV coatings. The erosion rate of the coatings was found to be linearly dependent on the H⁄E (elastic strain to break) ratio and decreased with increasing value of H⁄E ratio. The combined interaction of high hardness, increased electrical resistivity and improved erosion resistance properties suggests that the flame-sprayed HEA coatings can be used as multi-functional wear-resistant materials for energy generation applications. In the end, I am incredibly grateful to my parents Goutam and Mithu for letting me pursue my dreams, being present for me whenever I needed them, tolerating me and living with my absence from their life. I am obliged to Harshal for bringing joy and statistics to my life and being a constant support. I am so thankful to all my friends for being patient, listening to my cribbing and encouraging me whenever I was low. Lastly, I thank the universe for bringing my kitties-the love of my life, Mota and Luna to my life who made me immensely patient and were always by my side whenever I was sad or lonely.\n",

      "     BCC\n",
      "     , or a combination of both\n",
      "     . Although the FCC-based HEAs have excellent ductility and plasticity they lack considerable yield strength and require thermomechanical treatment before practical industrial applications resulting in increased cost\n",
      "     . In contrast, the BCC HEAs inherently have relatively high intrinsic yield strength because of the limited number of active slip systems\n",
      "     . Moreover, the BCC RHEAs have excellent high-temperature mechanical properties\n",

A hard object having a certain shape and size is used as an indenter and indented into the test material under certain pressure holding for a while before unloading. The hardness of the tested material can be determined from the relationship between the total indentation load and displacement or area.

This rationale for super-had coatings was based on the Archard wear model wherein the wear volume was found to be inversely proportional to the hardness of the softer material in a sliding/adhesive contact. However, super-hard coatings are usually susceptible to brittle fracture. Matthews, Leyland and co-workers have determined that in many practical wear situations hardness alone is not particularly an effective predictor of wear resistance\n",

Strong correlation between 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ and surface cracking in the indentation and bending of various oxide and nitride coatings have been reported by Musil and co-workers\n",

Higher hardness achieved for the AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings could be attributed to concurrent interactions of BCC phases and intermetallics coupled with the existence of oxide inclusions. Prior studies also reported the influence of hard intermetallic phases on high microhardness values\n",

The Al (0.143 nm), Mo (0.139 nm), W (0.139 nm) and V (0.136 nm) exhibits high atomic radius than Co (0.125nm), Cr (0.128 nm), and Fe (0.126 nm), which facilitate lattice distortion, which eventually may lead to solid-solution strengthening, thus, high hardness. Similar behaviour by the influence of vanadium (V) on both the FCC Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-V and BCC Cr-Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W-Hf-Ti-Zr families of the high-entropy alloy was reported previously by Yin et al.\n",
      "     . They have concluded from their work that the presence of vanadium is the key to high strength in both FCC and BCC high entropy alloys and have attributed this to the uniqueness in the atomic volume of vanadium in both BCC and FCC crystals vis-à-vis larger in FCC and smaller in bcc HEAs\n",

Although the eroded area appears to be large at 30° more volume loss of material i.e., a higher erosion rate has been recorded at an impact angle of 90° as compared to 30°. Erosion rates were 21%, 23 % and 29% lower for AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV respectively at an impact angle of 30° as compared to 90°. This suggests that the coatings undergo a brittle mode of erosion\n",

The eroded surface morphology at an impact angle of 30° has characteristic ploughing marks and lips. The presence of pits, microindents and a few cracks have also been observed. In contrast, the surface eroded at normal incidence (90°) shows the presence of large craters, wide cracks, micro-indents and lips.   The ratio of particle hardness to target hardness is known to have a strong controlling influence on the erosion mechanism. When this ratio is greater than 1 it results in indentation-induced fractures\n",
      "     . This ratio in our case is evidently greater than 1(hardness of sand particle approximately around 1500 to 1700 HV and coatings between 594 to 750 HV) leading to erosion by splat ejection and indentation-induced material removal. The erosion at an oblique impact angle of 30° is dominated by ploughing and cutting. As observed from the eroded surface morphology at oblique impact angles, the surface of the coatings is first cut by the erodent particles due to large horizontal stress to form furrows. The continuous impact of erosion particles then leads to the extrusion of materials to the edge and the formation of lips. The extrusion lip keeps accumulating material and deforming until it is removed from the surface by fracture. At vertical impact angles loss in material occurs due to the constant impact in the form of indents. The erodent particle impacting the surface of the coating at a normal angle result in the formation of microindents and the initiation of cracks. These cracks grow and propagate during subsequent continuous impact leading to the flaking of materials and the formation of craters. Thus, the major erosion mechanism at a vertical angle is dominated by cracking and crater formation\n",

However, limited, if any, studies on functional properties such as thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties of thermal sprayed HEA coatings have been pursued.\n",

      "     This thesis study explored the feasibility of using flame spraying as a potential manufacturing technique for high entropy alloys coatings. The mechanical and physical properties of the as fabricated flame sprayed coatings were then analyzed for potential multi-functional applications. The major outcomes of the study have been summarized below.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • Novel equiatomic AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings having an approximate thickness of 150 µm were fabricated by flame spraying on 316 L stainless steel substrates.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The microstructure of the HEA coatings was characterized using XRD, SEM and EDS.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     The HEA coatings showed BCC solid solution structures with the presence of mixed oxide regions due to oxidation in-flight.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • Vicker's microhardness tests indicated that the AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings has the highest average hardness followed by AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     Improvement in hardness is due to solid solution strengthening, BCC phases and a high fraction of oxide regions.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • Electrical characterization has shown that the flame sprayed HEA coatings exhibited high resistivity and negative thermal coefficient of resistance because of the large lattice distortions and s-d scattering of electrons.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The Joule heating studies have exhibited that the heating performance of all the three HEA coatings was 2 to 3 times better than that of flame sprayed Ni-20Cr. However, the three HEA coatings themselves showed similar heating performance at ambient temperature and free convection conditions. The improved performance has been attributed to the difference in electrical resistivity observed for Ni-20Cr and the HEA coatings.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The nanoindentation studies showed that AlCoCrFeMo has a higher elastic strain to break-𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio compared to the other two coatings because of its exceptionally lower elastic modulus compared to the other two materials.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • Solid Particle Erosion studies have shown that the rate of erosion for all three HEA coatings depends on the impact angle. A higher rate of erosion was observed at an impact angle of 90° in comparison to 30° suggesting a brittle mode of failure.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The erosion rate of all three coatings was found to be independent of temperature on testing up to 250 °C.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • It was statistically determined that AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW coatings have better solid particle erosion resistance than the AlCoCrFeMoV coatings.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     • The AlCoCrFeMoV coatings having the highest hardness had the least favourable erosion properties thus high hardness doesn't necessarily imply high erosion resistance. The erosion rate of the coatings was found to be linearly dependent on the 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ (elastic strain to break) ratio and decreased with increasing value of 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     algorithms based on the Monte-Carlo time series approach could be employed to predict the value of stable electrical resistivity and the ideal heat treatment temperature and duration. The train the model it will be fed with the data for the change in resistance with temperatures for ten heating cycles initially for a given coating. The predicted outcomes of the model can then be verified with a subsequent limited number of experimentations.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     In this initial study of the flame sprayed HEA coatings for heating applications the coatings were deposited over rectangular-shaped samples. Electrical components often have complex shapes and patterns. The issue of failure of the complex or patterned coatings at high operating temperatures due to the development of thermal stresses is of great concern from the industrial application point of view\n",
      "     . Thus, studying the fatigue, creep and failure properties of complex/patterned thermal sprayed HEA would be essential to understanding the practical feasibility of the proposed application.\n",
      "    </p>\n",
      "    <p>\n",
      "     The high electrical resistivity observed for the flame-sprayed coatings in this work has been attributed to the inherent nature of HEA (i.e., lattice distortion, disorder), the presence of oxides and other microstructural defects like pores. However, the single most significant factor or the relative influence of each of these factors has not been established. To understand the influence of oxides and porosity on the electrical resistivity HEA coatings having different oxide and porosity could be manufactured using different thermal spray techniques like cold spray and HVOF and their properties compared.\n",
