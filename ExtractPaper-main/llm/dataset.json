The FCC phase was found at the transition layer in Al-HEA MMC, with a high amount of Al matrix (82.79%), however, the atomic ratio of other elements Fe, Cr, Co and Ni remained the same. A further study was carried out by TEM analysis to gain a further understanding of the transition layer in the AlCoCrFeNi HEAs reinforced Al matrix composite. It is observed that the smooth transition layer between the HEA particle and Al matrix as shown in Fig. 31. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in Fig. 31 (d-e) represents an ordered BCC phase of HEA near the transition and the transition layer should have an ordered FCC structure. The transition layer has a high Al content and equal amounts of other Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni elements, which ensures good solubility of HEA in the Al alloy. Fig. 31 (c\u2013d) shows the grains of the 600 nm transition layer, which is less than 20 \u00b5m and 4 \u00b5m of Al matrix and AlCoCrFeNi HEA reinforcement, respectively. The mechanism of transition layer formed between HEA and Al matrix is demonstrated in Fig. 32. In the SPS method, the temperature distribution throughout the composite is not homogeneous, the neck (contact) zone of the particles has a higher temperature and it drops dramatically within the surface layer. The lattice-distorted HEA particles have a low thermal conductivity, about one- third that of pure Al, and these Al particles quickly transfer the heat contained in the transition layer due to this",

White shows the presence of CoCrFeNiMo0.2 HEA phase, light gray thick diffusion layer composed of HEA and matrix, gray titanium matrix phase.

CoCrFeNiMo0.2 HEAp elements Co, Ni and Fe are diffused at the outer edge of the diffusion layer with the titanium matrix. Some intermetallic compounds of Co, Fe and Ni may be present there. As the sintering temperature increases from 700 \u00b0C to 800 \u00b0C and 850 \u00b0C the diffusion layer thickness increases (Fig. 37 (b & c) backscattered image) and it becomes an inner and outer boundary.

The load transfer strengthening for micron- sized HEA, Orovan strengthening for submicron-sized HEA and particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN) mechanisms for greater than 1\u00b5m grain-sized HEA, acted behind the improved tensile strength. The composite tensile UTS value increased with increasing HEA content and the highest value of 220 MPa (Table 4) was found for 7.5 wt.% HEA-MMC. As seen in SEM images of composite in Fig. 74 the HEAps are uniformly dispersed but due to formation of cluster of HEAs it nullifies the strengthening effect of Orovan and this results in constent tensile YS for composites. However, the interfacial bonding between the reinforcement and the Mg matrix, due to the metallic nature of the HEA, it leads to improved strength and hardness. Both YS and UTS increase simultaneously in compression due to increased ductility. There was a Journal Pre-proof 67 drastic improvement from 2.5% HEA to 5% HEA, but near equal strength found from 5% HEA to 7.5% HEA. In compressive strength, the particles cluster in the microstructure (Fig. 74) does not cause discontinuities, and Hall-Pech, Orovan and load transfer equally play a role in increasing the YS and UTS of the composite. An increase in strength has been observed in composite materials as a result of several strengthening mechanisms such as particle-induced nucleation, Orovan strengthening and load transfer strengthening.

In STEM-HADDF imaging conditions, contrast arises from the collection of incoherently scattered high-angle electrons and, therefore, from variations in local atomic number between phases [18].

A comparison reveals that variant 15, Fe0.05Co0.4Ni0.5Ti0.05 HEA, exhibits the highest yield strength (11.59 GPa) and the highest yield strain (6.3 %). The TRIP mechanism observed in FCC HEAs can be categorized into two types: (1) FCC\u2192HCP and (2) FCC\u2192BCC. The proportion of HCP or BCC phases in HEAs can be used to evaluate the TRIP tendency during the tension process. Additionally, dislocation motion, specifically the Shockley partial dislocation density, can provide insight into the Stacking fault changes. From Fig. 8(a), it is evident that the HCP structure of all variants initially exhibits an upward trend. When combined with Fig. 8(b), this trend is linked to the movement of Shockley partial dislocations, which are associated with the HCP structure. As strain increases, with the exception of variants 8 (Fe0.1Co0.5Ni0.3Ti0.1) and 17(Fe0.05Co0.3\u00ad Ni0.6Ti0.05), the HCP structure in other variants begins to decline.

Observing the changes in the HCP structure and Shockley dislocations for each variant (Fig. 8(a) and b), it becomes evident that Shockley dislocations are closely tied to the HCP structure.

Up to a strain of 6.5 %, its HCP structure and Shockley dislocations share a similar trend, signifying that dislocations dominate the plastic deformation process during this phase. However, beyond a strain of 6.5 %, the HCP structure continues to increase with strain, while the Shockley dislocations remain relatively stable. This suggests that the increase in HCP structure results from an FCC to HCP phase transition. Overall, variant 15(Fe0.05Co0.4Ni0.5Ti0.05), exhibits delayed dislocation nucleation, indicating high strength. It also un\u00ad dergoes the earliest phase transition, signifying good plasticity.

With the further increase of stress, the precursor is transformed into BCC phase, and the constrained martensitic transformation occurs. Then, with the increase of stress, the deformation twins are produced. How\u00ad ever, under this tensile condition, the strength of the alloy is not so good, but the plasticity is excellent. Fig. 11 illustrates the tensile deformation process of the variant 15 (Fe0.05Co0.4Ni0.5Ti0.05), which exhibited the best performance, as dis\u00ad cussed in the preceding sections. In Fig. 11(a), at a strain of 6.3 %, a Lomer\u2013Cottrell dislocation forms in conjunction with appearance of ISFs owing to the motion of Shockley dislocations. Dislocation-driven mechanisms dominate plastic deformation, and with increasing strain, the ISFs gradually transform into ESFs. Notably, the Lomer\u2013Cottrell dislocation lock remains stationary, contributing to the overall strength of the material [44]. Fig. 11(c) presents the response as the strain increases to 8 %. At this point, a portion of the ISF phases begins to undergo a transformation into the HCP phase. This is the reason the Shockley dislocation, as depicted in Fig. 8, is associated with a decrease in the growth of the HCP structure. Meanwhile, the Lomer\u2013Cottrell dislocation lock remains un\u00ad altered, ensuring the TRIP effect contributes to increased plasticity and high strength. Upon reaching a strain of 10 %, as the HCP phase ratio continues to rise, a new Lomer\u2013Cottrell",

The main reasons for the increase in HDI stress are the increased recrystallization volume fraction and increased GND effective accumulation length. Since the hetero-deformation occurs between lamellar and spherical precipitate regions in the RX area, the related HDI stress contribution increases with the increase of RX%. Besides, it is found that the GND density variation in NRX area decreases from 2.5 \u00d7 1014/m2 to 1.2 \u00d7 1014/m2 initially and then increases to 1.5 \u00d7 1014/m2. The calculated HDI stress of the NRX area decreases from 856 MPa to 182 MPa which is caused by the decreased non-recrystallization volume fraction. Given this HDI stress of the NRX areas comes from the hetero-deformation between the RX and NRX areas, it is reasonable to deduce that this HDI stress source always decreases with the increase of RX%. The overall HDI stress is composed of the above two HDI stress sources in Table 1. The calculated values show good consistency with the experimental values in Fig. 10. Besides, the consistent HDI stresses also verified the applicability of the model by comparing the experiment and calculation values of single- phase HEAs. Thus, we deduce that two sources of HDI stress compensate each other and keep the HDI stress unchanged with the increase of RX%, contributing to the unchanged ductility in different RX% alloys.

Thus, we deduce that two sources of HDI stress compensate each other and keep the HDI stress unchanged with the increase of RX%, contributing to the unchanged ductility in different RX% alloys. As for the unchanged yield strength, we used EBSD and nanoindentation techniques to correct the strength affected by recovery- induced dislocation annihilation in Fig. S6. Analysis for the detailed strengthening mechanisms is included in Supplementary Mate\u00ad rials. As the recrystallized volume fraction increases, the contribution of continuous precipitation and dislocation strengthening gradually decreases in Table. S2. The contribution of lamellar precipitation strengthening and grain boundary strengthening increases constantly. The effects of the above two processes cancel each other out. Therefore, although the recrystallized volume fractions of three alloys are different, the values of yield strength remain unchanged which are close to 1.3 GPa (Fig. S7). 4.2. Formation mechanism of heterogeneous precipitates In light of the important role of heterogeneous precipitates in the mechanical properties, we here move to reveal the formation mechanism of precipitates. In Fang\u2019s and Gwalani\u2019s works (Fang et al., 2022b, 2022a; Gwalani et al., 2021), the discontinuous pre\u00ad cipitation is responsible for the formation of heterogeneous precipitates. According to Dasari\u2019s work, discontinuous precipitation will be retarded if the matrix relieves the supersaturation by precipitation (Dasari et al., 2021).",

Noteworthily, the concentration of the solute elements, Ti, and Al, shows a decreasing tendency from the boundary to the interior (insert of Ti map), as shown in Fig. 11(d). This discontinuity of concentration indicates that the formation of lamellar precipitates is controlled by a discontinuous solute-diffusion process. We have known that these precipitates are L12 phase by XRD and TEM analysis in Fig. 3 and the volume fractions of precipitates are similar and unchanged during annealing, which is a typical feature of a coarsening process for precipitate (Chellman and Ardell, 1974; Manna et al., 2001). Therefore, we conclude that the heterogeneous precipitates come from the discontinuous coarsening of the L12 phase in the current study. We sketched the discontinuous coarsening process in Fig. 12. Once the grain boundary meets the spherical L12 phase in NRX area in Fig. 11(c), particles on the boundary show faster coarsening rates and larger sizes than those in the interior",

In low-temperature dynamic compression experi\u00ad ments, the specimens produce hardening phenomena and dislocation slip is hindered to increase the short-range resistance. The existence of chemical short-range order (CSRO) during impact will cause the fluc\u00ad tuation of dislocation energy in the alloy, which will lead to the fluc\u00ad tuation of dislocation slip lattice resistance, and then activate various deformation mechanisms such as dislocation pinning, cross slip and twinning, ultimately promoting the improvement of the system strength and toughness [25].

The corrosion rate (CR) can be calculated from: CR = KicorrEW\u03c1\u22121 (1) where CR represents the corrosion rate (mm/year), K is a constant (3.27 \u00d7 10\u22123), icorr is the corrosion current density (\u03bcA/cm2), \u03c1 is the alloy density (g/cm3), and Ew is the equivalent weight. With the increase in annealing temperature, the Ecorr and the icorr decrease simultaneously. The A1100 specimen exhibits the lowest icorr (10.03 \u03bcA/cm2), indicating its best corrosion resistance. In contrast, the as-cast and A900 specimens have higher icorr than the A1100 specimen, implying poor corrosion resistance. To further investigate the corrosion mechanism, SEM images and EDS mappings of corroded surfaces after the polarization test are examined, as shown in Fig. 11. It can be found that the corrosion mainly appears in the Cu-enriched FCC phase. In contrast, no significant corrosion occurs in L21 and Laves phases. This phenomenon is attributed to galvanic corrosion because of the potential difference between the Cu- rich FCC and other phases. 4. Discussion 4.1. Microstructural evolution Examination of the microstructure and elemental distribution show that Cu tends to segregate to the ID region. This is attributed to its positive mixing entropy with other alloying elements, as shown in Table 4. The mixing enthalpies of Cu with Co and Fe are +6 kJ/mol and +13 kJ/mol, respectively. It is difficult for Cu to react with other ele\u00ad ments and form intermetallic compounds owing to the positive mixing enthalpies.

It is difficult for Cu to react with other ele\u00ad ments and form intermetallic compounds owing to the positive mixing enthalpies. However, the mixing enthalpies of Cu with Al and Ti are negative, indicating that a few Cu atoms can exist in the L21 phase, see Fig. 4. The mixing enthalpies of Al\u2013Co, Al\u2013Ti, Fe\u2013Ti, and Co\u2013Ti pairs possess low mixing enthalpies, which leads to Fe and Ti enrichment in Laves phase and Al, Co, and Ti enrichment in L21 phase. Sluggish diffusion is one of four core effects in HEAs, which can impede the formation of intermetallic compounds [53]. It is difficult for Ti and Cu atoms to diffuse at low temperatures on account of the larger atomic radius and sluggish diffusion. Thus, the as-cast specimen contains only a tiny amount of FCC and Laves phases. After annealing at 900 \u25e6C and 1100 \u25e6C, the volume fraction of FCC and Laves phases increased due to the high temperature during annealing, which increases the diffusion rate of Ti and Cu atoms. Simultaneously, the high temperature provided sufficient energy to coarsen the Laves phase. Table 1 Comparison of the wear resistance of some typical HEAs at room temperature.

Though the volume fraction of FCC and Laves phases increased in the A900 specimen, the FCC (10.4 %) has a higher volume fraction than the Laves phase (5.4 %), resulting in the decrease of hardness value compared with the as-cast specimen.

The sche\u00ad matic representation of the wear mechanism in AlCoCuFeTi is illustrated in Fig. 13.

Similar to the C0.3 alloy, The Ta elements are enriched in the Laves phase and the C and Cr elements are enriched in M7C3 carbide. The amount of segregation of the Cr element in the alloy also increases as the C element increases. Table 4 provides the specific elemental composition of the C0.5 alloy.

The results show that the amorphous carbon structure is graphitized and the bonding state gradually changes from sp3 hybrid to sp2 hybrid. 3.2. Microstructure and elements chemical states of the HEFs Fig. 3 shows the surface and cross-sectional morphology of the (CuNiTiNbCr)CxNy films. All samples show uneven granular bumps surface and the cross-sectional morphology of films are obvious differ\u00ad ences at different carbon contents. The H1 samples showing obvious columnar structures, while H2 sample shows denser non-columnar structures, and H3 sample shows finer columnar structures. With the further increase in carbon content, the columnar structure size of H4 sample increases slightly, and the H5 sample has a denser columnar structure. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the H5 sample. The low magnifica\u00ad tion images (Fig. 4a) reveal a clear contrast between light and dark areas, indicating the possible presence of different phases within the film. From the high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 4c and d), it can be seen that a large number of nanocrystals about 5 nm in size are wrapped by bright amorphous regions, which indicates the coexistence of amor\u00ad phous and nanocrystalline structures in the film. The grain size observed by TEM is basically consistent with that obtained from XRD results. The nanocrystalline region has a dark contrast due to the larger atomic mass of the metal, while the amorphous region contains a large number of carbon atoms, and the lower atomic mass",

The fracture toughness of the H3, H4, and H5 samples is 0.94 \u00b1 0.02 MPa m1/2, 0.92 \u00b1 0.03 MPa m1/2 and 0.96 \u00b1 0.05 MPa m1/2, respectively. It can be seen that the fracture toughness value of (CuNiTiNbCr)CxNy films is inconsistent with the variation trend of H/E and H3/E2. This result indicates the limitations of using H/E and H3/E2 to characterize the toughness of films. The increase in film toughness is related to the large amount of phase interface formed after the introduction of the carbonitride phase and amorphous carbon phase. The crack deflection and splitting occurred at the phase interface, and the stress intensity at the crack tip is reduced, resulting in the inhibition of crack spreading and the increase in film toughness. 3.4. Tribological properties Fig. 11a shows the friction coefficient curves of (CuNiTiNbCr)CxNy films deposited at different graphite target power. The friction co\u00ad efficients of the H1, H2, and H3 samples are very close, about 0.48. And with the increase in carbon content, the friction coefficients of H4 and H5 decrease to 0.35 and 0.27, respectively. The reduction of the friction coefficient is mainly related to the formation of a large amount of amorphous carbon phases with lubricating effect. Fig. 11b shows that the wear rate of (CuNiTiNbCr)CxNy films. With the increase of carbon content, the wear rate gradually decreases from 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 mm3/N\u22c5m (H1) to 1.0 \u00d7",

The addition of Mo in other HEAs systems can lead to severe lattice distortion of the alloy and pro\u00ad mote the formation of intermetallic phases in a similar mechanism [38].

The debris undergone obvious oxidation (position 1), while the oxidation of matrix was not obvious (position 2). At the edge of micron grooves, the material will also be oxidized after repeated deformation, which will produce cracks and spalling to form wear debris (position 3). However, the fish-scale-like delamination inside the micron grooves of the C-HEA sample was entirely due to fatigue-induced spalling, as no oxidation features were detected in this region (position 4). It is verified by EDS that a large number of oxidized areas (position 5) were observed in the micron grooves of the NbC-HEA sample, and the oxidized areas were often distributed around the NbC particles (position 6). In addition, the EDS analysis results also prove that NbC particles can block the grooves (position 7). The results of a large number of literatures also shown that the addition of carbides [38], borides [39], oxidases [40] and intermetallic [41] with higher hardness to the matrix can improve the wear resis\u00ad tance.

But the presence of HEA material was also detected in the area with no obvious adhesion char\u00ad acteristics, indicating that the HEA material had obvious material transfer to the WC balls. In addition, the percentage of oxygen atoms in the region with obvious adhesion characteristics was high, indicating that oxidative wear was presented. The above analysis shown that only the material in the sample transferred to the grinding ball in the form of adhesive wear, and the material in the grinding ball did not transfer to the sample. In addition, according to the analysis of the morphology of the grinding ball, the surface of the grinding ball was smooth and no obvious wear trace. Therefore, it can be determined that the grooves in the wear tracks of the sample were generated by the wear debris of the sample during the wear process under the abrasive wear mechanism, and the sample, the wear debris and the grinding ball produced a three- body wear state. The deformation mechanism of the alloy during the wear process was analyzed using EBSD of the subsurface structure of the wear track at 30 N load. The worn subsurface is divided into a severe deformation zone, a deformation transition zone, and a matrix [42].

The decrease in \u03c3y cal aligns with the experimental yield strength \u03c3y exp, validating the effectiveness of the empirical formula in predicting yield strength. The dominant factor influencing yield strength is solid solution strengthening (\u0394\u03c3ss), as depicted in Fig. 13. The contribution of grain-boundary hardening (\u0394\u03c3gb) to yield strength is relatively limited. The addition of Ti to the alloys leads to a significant reduction in solid solution strengthening. Consequently, the simulta\u00ad neous decrease in \u03c3mix, \u0394\u03c3ss and \u0394\u03c3gb occurs due to Ti addition, with the reduction in \u0394\u03c3ss being the most prominent. 3.8. Lattice distortion and electronic properties Lattice distortion is a prominent structural characteristic of high- entropy alloys and exerts a pivotal influence on their structural stabil\u00ad ity and solid solution strengthening. The non-uniform stress field generated by lattice distortion induces dislocation line bending, thereby increasing the resistance to dislocation motion and enhancing solid so\u00ad lution strengthening effect [22]. Fig. 14 shows that various elements randomly occupy the BCC lattice sites and exhibit obvious lattice distortions. The bond lengths (e.g., b1, b2, b3) and angles (\u03b1, \u03b2) deviate from the standard bond length (b",

A slight decrease of CoF to 0.68 for TB-600 can be attributed to its lower roughness resulting from its nanocrystalline dense microstructure.

This is due to their declining LC1 value, as shown in Fig. 10, with increasing B content, which forms h-BN, leading to a lower cohesive force in the film than the nitride-only coating, TB-0. This implies that small h-BN content worsens the tribological performance by lowering the cohesion among the crystals/nanocrystals in the films. A slight improvement of the wear rate in TB-600",

The corrosion resistances of TB-0, TB-200, TB-300, and TB-400 coatings were inferior to that of 304SS substrate due to their porous microstructures, which are shortcuts for electrolytes to attack the coat\u00ad ings. The constituent elements fail to form effective protective oxide films in such microstructures. As the porous columns become smaller and denser, the Ecorr value becomes more positive. Without porous columns, the Ecorr becomes more negative as the TB ratio increases from 0.51 in TB-500 to 0.58 in TB-600. Increasing B content leads to a more negative Ecorr due to the presence of small metal boride phases [38]. The corrosion resistance is not improved until TB-500 and TB-600 where the coatings become a dense microstructure film and devoid of porous col\u00ad umns. When B content reaches 4.9 at.% in TB-500, the corrosion resis\u00ad tance improves drastically to an Rp ratio of 3.8. As the coating microstructure becomes more nanocrystalline in TB-600 (TB ratio of 0.58) with B content of 6.4 at.%, the best corrosion resistance among the coatings is observed with an Rp ratio of 10.3, which is due to its comparatively dense microstructure resulted from its fine nanocrystal\u00ad line grains embedded in the amorphous matrix in TB-600 to retard the penetration of corrosive electrolyte. From the above analysis results, we can summarize that the effects on the AlCrNbSiTiBN coatings' quality are due to the amount of Ti and",

The results indicate that peak aging leads to a substantial increase in yield strength and ultimate strength by approximately 175 % and 75 %, respectively, while still maintaining a reasonable strain to fracture of ~ 14 % as against the solutionized sample. Fig. 5(c) illustrates the work- hardening curves for the solutionized and peak-aged samples. It is evident that the work-hardening behavior is significantly enhanced in the peak-aged sample compared to the solutionized one. The sol\u00ad utionized alloy exhibits a three-stage work-hardening behavior. Initially, there is a rapid decrease in hardening, indicating a softening effect. This can be attributed to processes such as stable dislocation generation and easy glide of dislocations. In the second stage, there is a gradual increase in hardening, suggesting the activation of additional strengthening mechanisms which increase the resistance to deforma\u00ad tion. Finally, in the third stage, the work hardening decreases again to Fig. 3.

Materialia 33 (2024) 102039 7 corresponding to the solutionized condition, the presence of micro-voids with a size of ~ 10 \u03bcm indicates a ductile fracture mode. This is consistent with the ductility observed in tensile testing. The fracture appears to be intergranular, as the entire grains are observed to have been pulled apart. Micro-void coalescence is observed to occur along the grain boundaries within the material. This plays a pivotal role in the subsequent crack formation and eventual failure of the specimen. On the other hand, Fig. 6(b) represents the peak-aged condition, where a combination of micro-scale dimples of ~ 1 \u03bcm and cleavage-type features are observed. This suggests a mixed- mode fracture behavior. The micrograph further indicates that the fracture predominantly occurs within the grains, indicating a trans\u00ad granular fracture mode.

An alloy with high V concentration shows various side effects such as immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and carcinogenicity [8]. Moreover, as shown by Fig. 6, the surface analyses revealed a highly oxidized surface due to natural passivation. This phenomenon fills the vacancies by oxygen affinity to\u00ad ward the oxidation of metals, promoting the formation of highly stable oxide layers [8]. Thus, with highly oxide-generated surfaces and an alloy with low V concentration, the TiMoVWCr HEA thin-film coatings showed superior cell viability. The results were evaluated by MTT assay at 570-nm absorbance. The stable oxide layers associated with TiM\u00ad oVWCr HEA are TiO2, MoO3, VO2, WO2, WO3, CrO3, and Cr2O3, favoring the generation of stable and homogeneous protective oxide layers. A similar observation was reported in an article on an NbTaTiVZr-based HEA [8]. However, the authors obtained the crystalline phase after an additional heat treatment [8]. The mechanical properties of the HEA resulted in remarkably high hardness and modulus. Furthermore, it also showed higher elastic and plastic deformation as well as high wear resistance. The elastic (H/E) and plastic (H3/E2) deformation obtained is 0.09 and 0.24 GPa which is much higher than NbTaTiVZr HEA. The H/E and H3/E2 values obtained for NbTaTiVZr HEA are 0.05 and 0.017 respectively [8].

The contrast of Cr element in the \u03c3 phase with a diameter of ~300 nm is darker than that of the matrix, while only the contrast of Mo element is brighter. This may be due to the small atomic radius of Cr element (0.129 nm). The pressure of 7 GPa makes Cr more inclined to dissolve into the matrix.

Electron diffraction confirmed the presence of the FCC phase.

The structural transformation of the film after nitrogen introduction can be explained as follows. According to reference [33], the mixing enthalpies of N with Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni are \u2212107, \u221287, \u221275, and \u221269 kJ/ mol, respectively. Namely, the film consists of reactive elements (Cr) and weak-reactive elements (Fe, Co, and Ni).

The hardness of the films was determined by measuring the hardness at an indentation depth equivalent to one-tenth of the film thickness. Notably, the substrate did not significantly influ\u00ad ence the film hardness. As the nitrogen gas flow rate increased, the hardness of the films increased gradually. At a nitrogen flow rate of 16 sccm, the hardness was nearly double that of the film without nitrogen flow (0 sccm). This increase in hardness can be attributed to two factors. First, an increase in the nitrogen content plays a crucial role. Nitrogen combines with the metallic elements and forms a ceramic phase known as Cr2N, which significantly enhances the film hardness. Second, TEM observations revealed a composite structure consisting of amorphous and nanocrystalline phases. The presence of abundant phase boundaries impedes the motion of dislocations, contributing to an overall enhancement in the hardness [37]. 3.6.

The occurrence of plowing grooves indicates the presence of abrasive wear mechanisms, which are typically observed when a harder material cuts into a softer material. In comparison, the 0 sccm film exhibits the lowest hardness, leading to more pronounced plowing grooves. In contrast, the 8, 12, and 16 sccm films, which have higher hardness, do not exhibit distinct plowing grooves, and the wear track surfaces appear relatively smoother. The mapping of the wear tracks in Fig. 12 shows that all film wear tracks exhibit the presence of oxides. This phenomenon is attributed to the generation of heat during the friction process, which causes surface oxidation in the wear tracks, leading to the presence of oxidative wear mechanisms in all films.",

As the nitrogen content increases to 34.9 at.%, the hardness of the coatings increases from 9.7 to 15.6 GPa due to the for\u00ad mation of transition metal nitride phases and solid solution strength\u00ad ening of the various elements [21]. However, the hardness drops to 14 GPa as the nitrogen content further increases to 48.8 at.%. It is impor\u00ad tant to point out that the relatively lower hardness of these (TiZrNb\u00ad SiMo)1-xNx HEA coatings than those reported in literature [11,12,19\u201322] is due to the formation of large amount of soft amorphous silicon nitride phase in this work. Yan et al. [10] reported that high entropy films (HEFs) present outstanding mechanical properties, with the incorporation of nitrogen and other elements contributing to a further improvement in the hardness of HEFs. Our previous study on TiZrNbTaFeNx HEA coatings also found that adding nitrogen signifi\u00ad cantly increased the hardness of HEA coatings from 9.9 to 36.2 GPa as the nitrogen content increased from 0 to 32.0 at.% [16]. A similar hardness enhancement effect by adding nitrogen has been reported in the literature [11,12,16\u201319]. However, the hardness further decreases to a lower value as the nitrogen content is higher than a critical point, which is frequently reported in the nitrogen-contained HEA coatings [16,18,19,21]. This hardness-decreasing tendency is attributed to target poisoning, where the transition shifts from reactive sputtering from the metal",

The resistivity value of the nitrogen-free N0 and N2 coatings is low, at approximately 214\u2013249 \u03bc\u03a9\u22c5cm, and increases to 766.5 \u03bc\u03a9\u22c5cm when the nitrogen content reaches 34.9 at.% (N4). Further an increase of nitrogen to 45.5 at.% (N6), the resistivity rapidly in\u00ad creases to a high value of 2322.9 \u03bc\u03a9\u22c5cm, and eventually reaches a maximum value of 3147.8 \u03bc\u03a9\u22c5cm when the nitrogen content reaches 48.8 at.% (N10). It has been reported that resistivity is often related to vacancies, dislocations and grain boundaries and associated micro\u00ad structural defects, as well as lattice distortions that contribute to elec\u00ad tron scattering [39]. Grain boundary scattering is the primary factor influencing the resistivity of polycrystalline metals, and when grain refinement becomes nanocrystalline, the electron mean free path de\u00ad creases [40]. Lattice strain in HEAs effectively retards the movement of electrons because severe lattice distortions are induced in them, espe\u00ad cially due to differences in atomic size between the alloying elements [41]. In other words, the degree of lattice distortion can affect the electrical resistivity of an alloy [42]. On the other hand, since the electrical resistivity of silicon nitride is ranging from 3.16 \u00d7 109 to 1.73 \u00d7 1011 \u03bc\u03a9\u22c5m [43], the amount of amorphous and high resistivity silicon nitride phase has a very strong influence on the increase of electrical resistivity of coatings.

As the addition of Cu element has improved the mechanical properties of ZrB2 ceramics [37], we made a decision to add the Fig. 3. FE-SEM image of the raw ZrB2 powders. Fig. 4. XRD pattern of the HEA powder prepared via mechanical alloying (35 h milling). Fig. 5. FE-SEM image of the 35-h milled HEA powders. Fig. 6.

In the present study, a non-equiatomic Ni25Co20Cu10Fe25Mn20 nanocrystalline HEA was first fabricated via mechanical alloying. Then, the ZrB2-5 wt% HEA samples were prepared by ball milling and spark plasma sintering. The microstructure and mechanical characteristics of samples were characterized. The densification mechanisms of ZrB2-5 wt % HEA ceramics were also studied. 2. Experimental steps 2.1.

Thus, the additive content in our research was selected to be 5 wt%. The ZrB2-HEA materials were manufactured using a sintering furnace (SPS-20T-10). A die (graphite) with a diameter of 30 mm was used to compress the powders. The inner surfaces of the die and the surfaces of the punches were covered with flexible graphite foils. The sintering temperature range of 1800\u20132000 \u25e6C, dwell time of 7 min, applied pressure of 30 MPa, and heating rate of 120 \u25e6C/min were considered as SPS variables. A vacuum of 40 Pa was applied throughout the fabrication process. After finishing the SPS process, the device was turned off and the specimens were cooled down to the ambient tem\u00ad perature inside the furnace. Fig. 1 depicts a schematic illustration of the mentioned steps to provide a better perspective for the readers. 2.2. Characterization After removing the outer layers of the samples through grinding, the bulk densities were calculated with the Archimedes method. The rule of mixtures was employed to calculate the theoretical densities. Then, relative density of the specimens was obtained through dividing bulk density by theoretical density.

A fracture toughness of 3.4 MPa m1/2 was reported for ZrB2 ceramics, sintered by HP at 1850 \u25e6C, with the addition of 4 wt% Ni [85]. Although the sintering conditions are almost the same and the Ni additive is one of the main elements in the Ni25C\u00ad o20Cu10Fe25Mn20 HEA, the obtained fracture toughness with Ni addition is smaller than the fracture toughness values in the current research. Addition of 13 wt% B4C and 4 wt% Ni to ZrB2 ceramic, fabricated by HP at 1850 \u25e6C, resulted in a fracture toughness of 4.5 MPa m1/2 [85]. This value is almost equal to the lowest fracture toughness (4.4 MPa m1/2) in the present research. Introducing La to ZrB2\u2013ZrC ceramic, processed by SPS at 1800 \u25e6C, led to a fracture toughness of ~2.6 MPa m1/2 [38], which is far lower than the results achieved for the ZrB2-5 wt% HEA samples. A fracture toughness of 4 MPa m1/2 was reported for SiC added ZrB2 ceramics manufactured by reactive HP at 1900 \u25e6C [86].

Introducing aluminum into the \u03b1-Ti phase results in a reduction in lattice constant of about 0.0064 %. The V and Nb elements undergo dissolution into the titanium lattice, resulting in the formation of a body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. The lattice deformation occurring between the body- centered cubic (BCC) phase and the \u03b1-Ti phase improves the strength of the multi-principal element alloys while diminishing its ductility. In the 70_HEA sample, there is a notable reduction in the content of the \u03b1-Ti phase, and the lattice constant reduces even further to 99.4 % of its initial value. Simultaneously, by introducing doping agents like Nb and V, the transformation temperature of the \u03b2 phase falls, leading to a higher proportion of \u03b2 phase being preserved as the dominant matrix phase, characterized by a typical body-centered cubic (BCC) structure.

When a small quantity of high-entropy alloy powder is introduced into the TA15 alloy matrix, the Al and Zr elements, which possess a high shear modulus, face challenges in functioning as solute atoms within the \u03b1-Ti lattice. Conversely, elements like Nb and Mo have the ability to integrate into the \u03b1-Ti structure by substituting certain Ti atoms. Consequently, \u03b1-Ti undergoes a transformation into \u03b2-Ti, and a minor portion of the \u03b2-Ti lattice further undergoes a transi\u00ad tion into the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, which contains a higher concentration of Ti, Nb, and V elements. Simultaneously, the elements Zr, V, and Al gather at the interfaces between grains, resulting in the formation of Laves phases. The high shear modulus of aluminum (Al) and zirconium (Zr) components poses a challenge for dislocations to traverse the grain boundaries.

The so\u00ad lidification rate, controlled by laser power and energy density, in\u00ad fluences the microstructural features such as grain size and phase structures. Low scanning speeds result in coarse grains, while higher scanning speeds lead to finer grains but insufficient bonding between layers. The layer thickness affects grain bonding and processing time, with improper parameters contributing to defects like porosity, cracks, pores, and foreign material inclusions [25]. Morphological analysis of AM-built samples reveals essential characteristics such as uniform grain distribution, phase formation, stability, densification, porosity, chemical homogeneity, mechanical properties, and texture. The size and disper\u00ad sion of grains contribute to improved mechanical properties through mechanisms like grain boundary strengthening, solid solution strengthening, and precipitation strengthening. The formation and sta\u00ad bility of phase structures also play a role in enhancing strength.",

Obstacles and prospects Despite the excellent results achieved by HEA in AM, there are still several challenges that need further attention in future research to address these gaps. Additionally, the synergetic effect of HEAs in AM- processed products is extensively covered in various fields, including medical, storage systems, transportation, aerospace, nuclear, and auto\u00ad motive industries. However, it is essential to summarize some of the challenges encountered during the process critically. These challenges are outlined below. \u2022 The better flowability of HEAs powder obtains enhanced homoge\u00ad neous distribution and packing density of AM-processed samples. Hence, the contributed HEAs should be spherical or near to spherical morphology that improves the AM build samples through the feed\u00ad stock of powders. \u2022 Despite as-printed multiphase HEAs have outstanding characteristics at ambient temperature, their mechanical qualities at higher tem\u00ad peratures are rarely described. HEAs, like Ni-based superalloys, exhibit intermediate-temperature embrittling (~650\u2013900 \u2103). This type of behavior may also occur in as-printed HEAs, and addressing this critical issue ought to serve as among the primary goals of future study. \u2022 The microstructure and phase stability of as-printed HEAs are critical factors in defining their working temperature range and engineering reliability. At room temperature, the inclusion of high-density dislocation networks is thought to improve the characteristics of the as-printed materials. However, understanding how these micro\u00ad structures evolve at high temperatures is critical. Furthermore, the effect of these dislocation structures on resistance to high- temperature creep and oxidation needs to be further investigated. Fig. 31. AlxCrFe2Ni2",

They were selected because of their spread from being weakly anisotro- pic to highly anisotropic and insuf\ufb01cient knowledge of their elastic moduli. The alloys were prepared by arc melting in a water-cooled copper hearth under Ar atmosphere from Ti, Nb, Ta, Fe, Zr, and Hf elements with purity >99.9%. Each sample was 50 g in weight, and the melting process was repeated at least \ufb01ve times to ensure com- position homogeneity. The samples were ground and polished using SiC abrasive papers. The phase constituents and correspond- ing lattice parameters were identi\ufb01ed by X-ray diffraction with Co Ka radiation (D8 Discover, Bruker, Germany). The Young\u2019s modulus was measured by using a sing-around ultrasonic velocity measur- ing instrument (UVM-2, Ultrasonic Engineering Co. Ltd., Japan), in which the longitudinal sound speed was measured for calculating the modulus. The mean value and standard deviation of \ufb01ve inde- pendent measurements were considered as the Young\u2019s modulus result. The hardness was measured using a micro Vickers hardness testing machine (HM-200, Mitutoyo, Japan), and at least 15 inde- pendent measurements were conducted for each sample. The mean value and standard deviation were considered as the hard- ness result. 3.

Recent experimental work for Ni-Mo and b-Ti alloys suggested that crystallographic texture in samples manufactured by SLM can be tailored by control of process conditions [46\u201348]. Speci\ufb01cally, the preferential growth orientation of columnar cells dependent on scanning strategy reported in the work of Ishimoto et al. on bcc Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al alloy [46] motivates below SLM textures. In this paper, we presume that texture design by control of SLM pro- cess conditions can also be achieved in the alloys studied in the present work (it is not implied, however, that a certain scanning strategy applied to different alloys results in the same preferential cell orientation; Figs. 1b1) and (c1) and accompanying text serve as illustration).

Theoretical elastic properties of single-crystal refractory high- entropy alloys The intrinsic elastic anisotropy in single crystals of cubic sym- metry renders them interesting for single-crystal implant materi- als, as the directional dependence of Young\u2019s modulus can be exploited to match the properties of bone. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the direction dependence of Young\u2019s modulus and determine directions of minimum Young\u2019s modulus. By the latter we understand the minimum across all possible directions of uni- axial load, min n E n \u00f0 \u00de. Similarly, the maximum Young\u2019s modulus is max n E n \u00f0 \u00de. To this end, we start by presenting the single-crystal Fig. 2. X-ray diffraction patterns of Ti45Zr45Nb5Ta5, Ti25Zr25Hf25Nb12.5Ta12.5, Ti20Zr20Ta20Hf20Nb20, and Ti40Zr10Nb30Ta10Fe10 HEAs. S.

The full dependence of E n \u00f0 \u00de on loading direction for the alloy with the smallest Au (Ti40Zr10Nb30Ta10Fe10) and the alloy with the largest Au (Ti45Zr45Nb5Ta5) are contrasted by surface plots in Fig. 3(a). A clear correlation between the magnitude of the universal aniso- tropy index and the shape of the Young\u2019s modulus surface is apparent. Turning to the torsion modulus T n \u00f0 \u00de, its variation with torque axis [Eq. (5)] depends on the same N4 angular term as Young\u2019s modulus.

Indeed, strong positive and nearly linear correlations between E 001 h i \u00f0 \u00de and C0 and between T 111 h i \u00f0 \u00de and C0 are evident in Fig. 4(b). The tetragonal shear elastic constant C0 of the transition ele- ments is well known to vary regularly across any of the three tran- sition metal element series [54,55]. This canonical behavior is rooted in the electronic structure of transition metals and mostly determined by the d-band \ufb01lling. The canonical trend was recently shown to be preserved in binary transition metal alloys [56]. While the d-band \ufb01lling is readily accessible to \ufb01rst-principles simula- tions, for practical purposes the VEC can be drawn upon instead. Note that increases of d-band \ufb01lling go in parallel with increases of VEC. Fig. 4(c) shows that the E 001 h i \u00f0 \u00de and T 111 h i \u00f0 \u00de increase with VEC of RHEAs. The correlations are approximately linear despite some apparent scatter. A reason for why the correlations between either modulus with C0 is better than with VEC is that C0 takes into account electronic structure differences between the transition metal series (resulting in elastic constants differences between 3d; 4d, and 5d series for the same band \ufb01lling parameter), but the VEC does not. Nonetheless, the quality of the correlation suggests that the VEC may serve as an easily accessible and fairly accurate parameter to tailor the single-crystal properties of the present and related",

Fig. 4(f) shows that both moduli are also positively cor- related with the VEC. GS iso and ES iso correlate less strongly with either C0 or VEC than the single-crystal counterparts from Figs. 4(b) and (c).

        "input": "4 shows that both RTa and RTc textures in Ti45Zr45Nb5Ta5 can moderately reduce Young\u2019s modulus below the isotropic value of 91GPa. For either rolling texture, a sharper texture, as quanti\ufb01ed by a larger texture index t, has the effect of reducing the minimum Young\u2019s modulus. This is due to a decrease in spread of texture orientations (smaller half-width j). Simultane- ously, the anisotropy of Young\u2019s modulus, if measured by the dif- ference between maximum and minimum values (Table 4), increases with texture sharpening. Both trends are more pro- nounced for RTc than RTa. This can be understood from the higher texture index of RTc for the same j value. Furthermore, changes in ES D E h; / \u00f0 \u00de with j depend on the loading direction under consider- ation. The direction of minimum Young\u2019s modulus does not lie par- allel to RD, TD, or ND for either RTa or RTc texture. The direction of the maximum Young\u2019s modulus for RTc (Table 4) is along ND, since the dominant c-\ufb01ber component preferably aligns one of the 111 h i single-crystal directions parallel to ND. The directions of the min- imum Young\u2019s modulus for RTa and RTc cases agree incidentally, as both textures contain a-\ufb01ber and c-\ufb01ber components. Figs. 5(a) and (b) illustrate how ES D E h; / \u00f0 \u00de varies with loading direction for textured aggregates of Ti45Zr45Nb5Ta5 possessing RTa texture and RTc texture, respectively.

Sharper texture leads to lower minimum Young\u2019s mod- ulus and higher maximum Young\u2019s modulus, similar to the effect of texture sharpening in the case of the rolling textures. For the same value of the half-width, the amplitude of deviation from the ES iso is obviously higher for the SLM-type textures than for the \ufb01ber tex- tures. These observations directly result from the presence of cube or Goss texture components and the absence of \ufb01bers, which pre- serve much of the single-crystal elastic character in the SLM tex- tured specimens. This is also re\ufb02ected in a higher texture index t, signifying that many crystallites possess similar orientation. The smaller the spread of cube or Goss texture orientations, the more closely the single-crystal elastic properties are retained. An obvi- ous difference between SLMC and SLMG is that the minimum Young\u2019s modulus appears along the XD, YD, and BD sample direc- tions for the former, but only along XD for the latter. This is a con- sequence of the fact that cube and Goss textures orient individual grains differently with respect to the sample coordinate system. In practice, one of the two textures and associated direction of mini- mum Young\u2019s modulus might, however, be preferred for different reasons, including machining the implant, or having the lowest Young\u2019s modulus pointing in a certain direction relative to the melt pool boundaries.

[29], all these effects actually take place in the Cantor alloy even at the early stages of plastic defor\u00ad mation. Further, we examined the microstructure of the samples using optical and electron microscopy techniques (see Fig. 2). As follows from the pictures, the optical imaging provides better visualization of the structural morphology formed during crystallization as well as cold-rolling processes. Before micrographs were taken, the samples were mechanically polished and etched in a solvent mixture of alcohol and HF acid to achieve a slightly pitted surface. Since dendrites are chemically inhomogeneous in volume, pitting processes caused by etching expose the edges of the dendrites, which makes it possible to visually determine their shape even in the case of barely noticeable segregation of elements observed in the HEAs under study. As a result, we reveal that all the as-cast samples have a dendritic microstructure with randomly oriented crystals several microns in size. The Cantor alloy has the finest dendrites, whereas the refractory alloys have enlarged ones. Note that there are no parasitic inclusions or secondary phases in the",

Conclusions The effects of pressure and elastic deformation on the electrical resistance of TiZrHfNb, TiZrHfNbTa and FeCoCrMnNi (Cantor alloy) high entropy alloys have been studied for the first time. The main out\u00ad comes of this research are as follows. (1) The pressure coefficients of the relative resistance 1 \u03c10 \u2202\u03c1(P) \u2202P are found to be negative but fairly large in magnitude. The baric dependencies are successfully described within the framework of the proposed simple model, which takes into account only two contributions, such as residual resistance (Drude term) and s- d scattering resistance (Mott term). (2) The resistivity of the examined alloys reveals strictly linear changes under applied stress. The defined strain gauge factor (GF) is found to be as large as GF = 3.49\u20134.78, compared to that of commonly used commercial strain gauge alloys such as Constantan (GF = 2.0\u20132.2) and Manganin (GF = 0.5\u20130.7). Based on the analysis of the results, we make the assumption that the high strain gauge sensitivity in the HEAs is mainly due to a drastic change in their the Debye temperature \u0398D that occurs during elastic tension. (3) The DFT calculations show that the electronic structure of the HEAs changes weakly under stress and pressure. The variations in the DOS are too small to be taken into account to interpret the effects of pressure and tension on the resistivity in the systems. (4) Analysis of the examined properties allows us to conclude that high entropy alloys have a unique combination of",

Thermal properties High entropy alloys generally possess considerable thermal con\u00ad ductivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, low specific heat ca\u00ad pacity, and averagely good thermal diffusivity. Movement of electrons in HEAs is distorted by the amalgamation of multiple elements resulting to lattice distortion. Even though, it is not appropriate to take into consideration only the role of electrons in the conduction of heat in HEAs because there are other heat carriers like phonons, photons and magnons [70,71]. Thermal conductivity is ideally a function of electrical conductivity and temperature following Weideman-Franz\u2019s law [72]: ke=Lo\u03c3T (i) where ke is electronic thermal conductivity, Lo is the Lorentz constant and takes the value of 2.45 \u00d7 108 W\u03a9/K2, \u03c3 is the electrical conductivity and T is the temperature. In a study to determine the thermal conduc\u00ad tivity, k comprising electron thermal conductivity ke, and phonon thermal conductivity, kp (since it was not magnetically ordered as to include magnon), of Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA over a temperature range of 300\u20131100 K, it was observed that the two components of k decreased with temperature as shown in Fig. 6 [73]. The authors reported that electron thermal conductivity \u03bae was due to electron contribution from metals. And the impact of \u03bap to \u03ba in the HEA cannot be ignored because the ratio (\u03bap/\u03bae) ranged from 1.853 to 3.905, which was far much bigger than what is obtainable in traditional metals.

This is because of high level of arbitrariness or disturbances at their atomic level. This uncer\u00ad tainty is provoked by the large number of dissimilar elements coming together to form a HEA. However, microstructures of SPSed HEAs are usually refined, having their grain sizes reduced to nanometers which usually improves their properties like strength [88], fracture toughness [89], thermal stability [55] and wear/corrosion resistance [59,90]. However, high degree of randomness accompanying consolidated HEA leads to the evolution of new phases in the microstructure.

Solid solution strengthening is not universally obtained in conventional alloys. Hence, thermal stability as a result of that is absent. [65] The solid solution strengthening in HEAs equips it with multiple slip systems and this enhances its strength and ductility. Most conventional alloys compromise mechanical strength, hardness for ductility. [66] Low chemical reactivity of HEAs decreases microstructural segregation and embrittlement. Conventional alloys are affected by chemical segregation and embrittlement. [67] Sluggish diffusion effect in HEAs suppresses grain growth and recrystallization of microstructure.

High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) Conventional Alloys (CAs) Ref HEAs have disordered atomic configuration that leads to lower thermal expansion which increases its thermal stability. The atomic configuration of conventional alloys is more ordered which leads to a higher thermal expansion and lower thermal stability. [80] The disordered microstructural configuration of HEAs leads to increased phonon scattering and lower thermal conductivity useful in heat shield and insulators There is more ordered structural configuration in CAs leading to higher thermal conductivity and are not suitable in thermal shielding. [81] Large number of different elements in HEAs with different atomic radii leads to higher phonon scattering and subsequent lower diffusivity. Fewer number of atoms make up conventional alloys and leads to fewer scattering of phonon and subsequent higher diffusivity. [82] A high number of dissimilar atomic sites in HEAs contributes to higher phonon scattering lowering thermal conductivity. The atomic sites are similar in conventional alloys and heat transfer is more organized and accelerated. [83] The short-range order exhibited by HEAs decreases their lattice thermal conductivity, most often in most HEAs. The long-range order in conventional alloys increases their thermal conductivity [79] The short-range order increases grain boundaries and reduces dislocation motion, leading to higher thermal stability. The long range order supports dislocation motion and contributes to lower thermal stability in CAs [79] The large entropy of formation of HEAs results to larger activation energy of diffusion, which suppresses grain growth and increases",

For TEM analysis of these RHEAs, samples were thin\u00ad ned down to a thickness of ~30-20 \u03bcm. A 3 mm diameter samples were punched from the thinned foil and was further subjected to twin-jet electro polishing (Struers model no TenuPol \u22125). For electrolytic thin\u00ad ning, a 5 % Perchloric acid and Methanol at a temperature of 243K with applied Voltage, 23 mV and 80 mA was used for obtaining electron transparent sample for TEM.

The renaissance in physical metallurgy has enunciated the discovery of high entropy alloys (HEAs) [49]. These multicomponent equiatomic HEAs were found to have sin\u00ad gle phase solid solution for the first time in the year 2004 by Cantor et al. [2] and Yeh et al. [3] independently. The high entropy effect in these alloys were considered to be responsible for formation of single phase solid solution [48]. However, the recent review article by Steurer [50] has demonstrated that only eighty (80) HEAs composition forms single phase solid solution. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study the phase evolution in these RHEAs prepared through VAR. In the present investigation, concentrated efforts were made to un\u00ad derstand phase formation in these RHEAs through parametric approach. The various thermodynamic parameters like enthalpy of mixing (\u0394Hmix), entropy of mixing (\u0394Smix), atomic size difference (\u03b4), valence electron concentration (VEC), and electronegativity difference (\u0394\u03c7) were computed for understanding the phase formation in RHEA1, 2",

Whereas in quinary RHEA, the experimental findings were having slight deviation with the DFT calculations. The possible reason for such an anomaly may be the number of atoms considered in generating the SQS in these non- equiatomic RHEAs. The microhardness predicted through DFT calculations were also found to be in good agreement with experimental results for MoNbTaW and MoNbTiW system using SQS model (Fig. 8). However, deviation in the microhardness from DFT and experimentation was observed in case of quinary non-equiatomic RHEA (Table 3 and Fig. 8). The modulus of elasticity for RHEA1 and RHEA3 obtained using rule of mixture (ROM) were found to be in close approximation with those predicted through DFT and experimentation (Table 3 and Fig. 8). The bulk modulus B is typically used to characterize the measure of resistance to volume changes by the applied pressure. The stiffness of materials is usually characterized by modulus E and G. The Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd ranges from 0 < \u03bd < 0.5. When Poisson\u2019s ratio is 0.5, it means that volume remains constant under tensile or compressive tests. If Poisson\u2019s ratio slightly less than 0.5 means that the material slightly increases in volume when subjected to tensile stress and slightly decreases in volume when subjected to compressive stress. The larger the Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd value, the better the plasticity of the material. Moreover, B/G > 1.75, and \u03bd > 0.30 both meet the",

The Tabor\u2019s equation [70] used here to calculate the YS of alloys as shown in equation (12): \u03c30.2 = Hv 3 (12) From Tables 3 and 5 and it is clear that the microhardness and yield strength values do not obey the values computed from ROM. Similar findings have been reported in RHEA in previous studies [71]. There\u00ad fore, various other factors contributing to the overall strength of alloys needs to be taken in to consideration. The other factors contributing to the overall strength are (i) solid solution strengthening (\u03c3sss), (ii) grain size strengthening (\u03c3gss), (iii) precipitation strengthening (\u03c3ps), and (iv) dislocation strengthening (\u03c3ds). Among these parameters, the solid so\u00ad lution strengthening is most likely responsible for the alloy\u2019s extraor\u00ad dinary microhardness and YS. In the present investigation, contribution from precipitation can be neglected. The contribution from the various factors on the microhardness of these RHEAs have been shown in Fig. 9 and Table 3.

Comparing the yield strength of three different alloys using different model with experimental values. S. Kumar et al. Intermetallics 164 (2024) 108080 12 diagram can be discussed on the basis of VEC. There is inverse relation exist between VEC and hardness of alloys. The VEC of alloy MoNbTaW is 5.5 and hardness of major phase is 4.46 GPa whereas VEC of alloy MoNbTiW is 5.25 and having hardness of major phase 4.81 GPa in the similar way VEC of alloy MoNb(TaTi)W is 5.37 and hardness is 4.69 GPa. Similar relation has been observed by Balasubramanian et al. [72] for his study on carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides. Fig. 7 (e) showing variation of elastic constant and crystallite size with composition. All these alloys are ductile in nature (B/G > 1.75 and \u03bd > 0.3). The B/G ratio and \u03bd value of MoNbTa0.5Ti0.5W is higher than rest of two alloys, sug\u00ad gesting higher ductility. The result of higher ductility of MoN\u00ad bTa0.5Ti0.5W is supported by higher elastic constant. This phenomenon can be explained on the basis of dislocation strengthening.

Characterization The sample was cut into a size of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 5 mm to analyze the laser cladding CoCrFeNiTi_(1-x) Mo_x high-entropy-alloy coating. The mixed solution (HCL: HNO3 = 3 : 1) was dropped on the coating surface for 10\u201360 s. Then, the sample was placed in an alcohol solution after corrosion. Ultrasonic cleaning was used to remove dirt on the surface for analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (High-Technologies TM3030Plus, Hitachi, Japan) was used to measure the morphology of the cladding. Besides, an energy spectrometer (Model 550i, IXRF, USA) was used to test the composition and distribution of elements. The performance tests of the coating included microhardness, nano- indentation, frictional wear, and corrosion resistance. A microhardness tester (MVA-402TS, HDNS, China) was utilized to measure the micro\u00ad hardness of the coating at the 500-g pressure for 10 s.",

BCC-phase generation is the highest among the five high-entropy-alloy coatings in the solid solution with BCC and FCC phases. Ec = 1 n ( En\u2212 \u2211 \u03b1Eatom ) (1) where Ec is cohesive energy; En is total energy; Eatom is single-atom en\u00ad ergy; n is the total number of atoms; \u03b1 is the atom number of each element. The elastic constant, a physical quantity that characterizes the elas\u00ad ticity of a material, directly affects material performance. The partial equality relation is achieved between the elastic constants, that is, C11\u2013 \u2013C22 = C33, C44\u2013 \u2013C55 = C66, and C12\u2013 \u2013C23 = C13. Therefore, three independent elastic constants can be obtained by evaluating the mean value [20]. Table 4 lists the calculation results. The mechanical stability of the cubic structure can be judged according to the elastic constant. Eq. (2) shows the reasons for judgment.

In theory, the higher the hardness, the better the wear resistance, and the less the wear mass loss of COF. However, the wear mass loss in TM31 is the highest among all coatings. The CoTi2 diffraction peak in TM31 becomes wider with increased x from an XRD perspective, indicating a larger grain size. Spherical phase CoTi2 is larger than other coatings, and the large hard phase is more likely to fall off under pressure during wear from a microstructure perspective. Abrasive particles form in the friction pair, and extensive grinding is conducted on the coating surface. Consequently, the wear mass loss of TM31 exceeds that of TM40 when the COF for TM31 is significantly lower than that for TM40. Grooves are uniformly distributed across the coating after wear.

The theoretical calculation of the work focuses on the theoretical calculation of solid- solution high-entropy alloys. It is used to clarify the crystal properties of high-entropy alloys and guide the preparation of high-entropy alloy coatings. The coating prepared during the test contains intermetallic compounds, so there is a certain deviation between the theoretical calculation and the actual conclusion.

Close values are expected if the supercell is large enough. To highlight the importance of atomic relaxations in the HEA, we also consider different relaxation schemes when computing the elastic constants. First, no atomic relaxation is performed (denoted NR for non- relaxed), i.e. we consider atoms on a perfect BCC lattice. The second scheme involves partial relaxations (denoted PR), i.e. starting from the fully relaxed state, the strain is applied and no further relaxation is performed. Finally, in the full relaxation scheme (denoted FR), the strained cell is fully relaxed. This last scheme leads to the true elastic constants of the alloy. 3. HEA bulk behaviour 3.1. Elastic constants of pure elements Before studying the elastic behaviour of the HEA, we compute the elastic constants of the five elements composing the HEA in their pure BCC phase at their equilibrium lattice parameter (Table 1). The BCC structure is the stable phase of niobium and tantalum. Thus all their elastic constants are found positive, in agreement with previous ab initio studies [22,43\u201348].

The BCC lattice of the HEA is found to fulfil the mechanical stability criteria (\ud835\udc3644 > 0, \ud835\udc3611+2\ud835\udc3612 > 0 and \ud835\udc3611 > \ud835\udc3612). \ud835\udc3644 and \ud835\udc36\u2032 are independent of the chosen orientation among the three possible cubic directions with a variation of at most 1 GPa that can be neglected. The 125-atom SQS supercell is therefore large enough to reproduce the cubic symmetry expected for the elastic answer of the random HEA. With an elastic anisotropy ratio \ud835\udc34= \ud835\udc3644\u2215\ud835\udc36\u2032 = 1.6 much larger than 1, this HEA is found to have a high elastic anisotropy. The elastic constants significantly depend on the relaxation scheme, with \ud835\udc3644 and \ud835\udc36\u2032 the most sensitive. Notably, a significant increase in \ud835\udc36\u2032 is obtained when the atomic positions are fully relaxed, as also evidenced in TaTiHf alloy [53]. Therefore it appears necessary to consider the full atomic relaxations to accurately determine the elastic constants in this HfNbTaTiZr HEA. Our results are in very good agreement with Ref. [54] also em- ploying VASP but differ from previous ab initio calculations based on the Emto-Cpa approach [52]. We see that different values are obtained (Table 2), in particular for the shear modulus \ud835\udc3644 which is much larger with Emto-Cpa leading to a much higher elastic anisotropy. This discrep- ancy between Vasp and Emto-Cpa calculations cannot be rationalized with a different handling of atomic relaxations. Indeed allowing or not the relaxation in our Vasp calculations does not reduce the difference between the two ab initio approaches.",

The AlCoCrFeNiCu compositional blend possesses the maximum near equiatomic ratio, solidifying to form solid solution phases [62]. The load-displacement (P-h) curves of the samples are shown in Fig. 5 with succession loading and unloading stages. Interestingly, the tilt of the A301 steel unloading retract curve showed the baseplate was trying to recover from deformation, however, the indentation depth of the A301 steel substrate was greater than the AlCoCrFeNiCu coatings with a penetration depth of about 2500 nm. Thus, suggesting that the HEA coatings are more resistant to plastic deformation than the steel substrate, attributed to the BCC strengthening phase and the lattice distortion effect of the HEA [63].

The nano-scale nature of this method enables the use of experimental readings of indenter load and depth of penetration. These readings are employed to indirectly measure the contact area at full load; thus, enabling hardness calculations. Hardness measurements are based on the indentation area function and the maximum applied load, as depicted in Eq. 1. Throughout the loading and unloading segments of the nanoindentation testing, indentation load and depth are continu\u00ad ously recorded, providing insights into hardness as a function of depth beneath the surface. H = Pmax Amax (1) where Pmax is the predetermined maximum load and Amax is the indenter area at maximum load, related to the contact depth, hc. To determine the projected area of contact between the indenter and the specimen at maximum load, the precise measurement of contact depth into the specimen surface is employed in conjunction with the known indenter tip geometry [4].

Third, the above two steps will naturally give an excellent agreement with the stress-strain curves in the first loading stage, but the unloading and cyclic responses require the fitting to the backstress evolution in Eq. (7), where \u03be and \u03b7 are the governing constitutive parameters. Fitting to both lattice strain evolu\u00ad tion in subsequent cycles (e.g., Fig. 9) and the overall stress-strain curves, results can be seen in Fig. 8 for these two alloys, illustrating the comparison between the mentioned two methods for specific cycles, where the initial tension and first ten cycles of simulated results are compared to the specific experiment data, i.e., initial tension, 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 10th cycles. Simulation results show good agreement with the experiment data. With the increase of the number of cycles, the simu\u00ad lation results revealed the trend of the increasing stress amplitude. This result is consistent with the trend of the experiment and shows the cyclic-hardening effect of this alloy in the low-cycle number range. However, a similar phenomenon was observed in Al0.5CoCrFeNi under cyclic loading within the initial cycles [20], where rapid multiplication of dislocations existed. Another phenomenon should be noted is that the premature yielding behavior happens during the subsequent cycles after the initial tension. This result mainly correlates to the so-called Bau\u00ad schinger effect, which results from the kinematic-hardening mechanism and has been found in Cantor alloy [50]. The existence of this effect causes a gentle rather than sharp change at the excessive position from Fig. 8.",

        "input": "1). Successive cycles have already been shown in Fig. 8(b). Back stresses are usually used to understand the dislocation behavior of metals and alloys under cyclic loading [51]. Dislocations will pile up against the interfaces to increase the plastic heterogeneity between different phases, which may lead to an increase in the back stress with the increasing cyclic numbers in low strain amplitudes [26]. The back stresses resulting from the dislocation accumulation of the incoherent precipitate could cause a lower LCF life. As shown in Eq. (7), the evo\u00ad lution of the back stress in a specific micro deformation system \u03b1 mainly contains two terms (\u03be and \u03b7) in the simulation. The \u03be represents the linear kinematic hardening and the \u03b7 is for the dynamic recovery. The fitting procedure has been discussed earlier in this section. As can be seen in Table 1, the value of \u03be increases dramatically from 3000 MPa in the FCC sample to more than 11000 MPa in the FCC + B2 sample, while the \u03b7 values are similar in the two samples. The effect of linear kinematic hardening term related to the coefficient \u03be on back stress is dominant. This means that the introduction of the B2 precipitates mainly affects the kinematic hardening of \u03b1 system in the matrix grains, while the effect on dynamic recovery is relatively weak. From the simulation results, the value of \u03be increased due to the appearance of B2 phase, indicating that the B2 precipitate and its accompanying plastic heterogeneity indeed",

Therefore, the introduction of the B2 phase mainly increased the total back stress by affecting the kinematic hardening effect of the matrix grain slip system, and the increase in the back stress was the main reason for the decrease in the fatigue life of Al0.3CoCrFeNi with B2 precipitates. 5. Conclusions The B2 precipitates increased the yield strength and decreased the LCF life in the Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA. The EVPSC model was used to simulate the LCF behavior of the Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA based on the in-situ neutron diffraction measurements, which helped to understand the role of back stress in the LCF. The simulation results indicate that the B2 precipitates will increase the back stresses during cyclic loading by facilitating the kinematic hardening",

The blended powders were obtained by mechanical ball milling in a vacuum environment by loading stainless steel milling balls and powders with a mass ratio of 10:1 into a planet horizontal ball mill. The mixed powders were placed in a vacuum hot- pressing furnace and sintered at 823 K for 1 h to obtain HEAp/Al com\u00ad posites. (It should be noted that graphite paper is required between the powder and the mold to prevent the composite from bonding with the mold during the hot pressing-sintering process, which would make it difficult to remove the specimen and even damage the mold.) After sintering, the specimens were put into a program-controlled electric resistance furnace for heat treatment and removed after holding at 773 K for 8 h, 24 h, and 96 h, respectively, and cooled to room temperature in atmospheric conditions [17].

According to the previous work [17], there was no diffusion layer formation at the interface between HEAp and matrix when the HEAp/Al composites were annealed at lower temperatures, despite the extension of the annealing time. Based on the above equa\u00ad tion, the diffusion layer thickness (y) is principally associated with D0, Q, and T.

Consequently, the material can overcome the energy barrier (\u0394Gm) and leap only at a sufficiently high processing temperature, i.e., when the internal atoms acquire sufficient diffusion activation energy (Q), enabling the diffusion of elements in the composite. It is notable that thermodynamic motions of uniform materials have been found to be disordered",

Now, a first-principles calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) is a reliable and effective method for predicting the sta\u00ad bility, electronic structure, and mechanical properties of various inter\u00ad metallic compounds and alloy systems [14]. Zhang et al. [14] and Chen et al. [19] have verified the experimental results of nanoindentation mapping by the DFT method and proved the accuracy of the NanoBlitz 3D method. In this case, the elastic modulus, hardness, and Poisson\u2019s ratio of the material can be calculated according to the following equations: E = 9BG 3B + G (6) H = 0.151G (7) \u03bd = 3B \u22122G 2(3B + G) (8) Where B and G are the bulk and shear moduli calculated by the Voigt- Reuss-Hill method (VRH), respectively, and \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio [14,19,40]. In a previous investigation [41], the elastic constants of AlxCoCrFeNi HEA with different Al elemental contents (x) were calcu\u00ad lated and analyzed, and the results are shown in Table 3. By substituting the values in Table 3 into equations (6)\u2013(8) and comparing the results with the elastic modulus and hardness of the Al0.6CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy obtained by the NanoBlitz 3D method, the experi\u00ad mental values are within the predicted values of the DFT method.

Moreover, it was found that each sample contained approximately 14 at. % Oxygen (minor content, approximately 2 wt%), which is mainly because the TiZrNb target and Ta target formed by hot pressing sintering tends to retain oxygen as well as the oxygen affinity of Ta metal. Fig. 2 shows the SEM surface morphologies of 16 independent Ti-Zr- Nb-Ta HEA samples with different compositions.

It can be seen that the EOCP of the samples in the first row is between \u22120.39 and \u22120.44 VSCE. As the Ta content in\u00ad creases, the EOCP of the samples in the second row moves in a more positive direction, between \u22120.30 and \u22120.37 VSCE, reaching a maximum, indicating that the samples in the second row have the smallest corrosion tendency overall. The maximum EOCP at this time is attributed to the combined effect of the overall amorphous structure and the appropriate amount of Ta. The amorphous structure is more stable in corrosive environment due to the absence of grain boundaries, while the higher Ta content in the samples in the second row can contribute to the formation of stable Ta2O5 passivation film on the sample\u2019s surface in corrosive environments [32]. The EOCP of the samples in the third row is between \u22120.36 and \u22120.40 VSCE, which is comparable to the EOCP of the samples in the fourth row (\u22120.37 to \u22120.42 VSCE).

It is evident that the whole combinatorial sample is nanostructured with the crystallite size ranging between 10 and 30 nm. In the BCC and FCC phases, the crystallite size values vary between 20-30 and 10-20 nm, respectively. This suggests a finer nanostructure in the FCC phase. The dislocation density values were in the range of 70-270 \u00d7 1014 m-2 if the whole coating is considered.

Compositional dependence of the phase content and the lattice constant The phase map determined by XRD and shown in Fig. 3 is worth comparing with theoretical predictions. Different theoretical methods have been elaborated for the prediction of the phase content as a function of the chemical composition of MPEAs [31-35]. The most straightforward procedure is based on the valence electron concentration (VEC), which predicts the compositional dependence of the formation of FCC and BCC phases [36]. VEC is obtained as the average of the VEC values of the constituents weighted with their atomic fractions [37]. It was claimed that an",

For the as- deposited coatings, the thickness reduces from 1.91 to 0.76 \u03bcm as the nitrogen flow rate increases from 0 to 20 sccm due to the target poisoning effect under high nitrogen concentrations in the sputtering chamber [30], In particular, a high Ar flow rate increases the number of collisions between the Ar ions and the other ions in the deposition process, and therefore reduces the energy of the sputtered ions and the number of ions incident on the substrate [31]. However, in the present study, the introduction of nitrogen into the deposition process reduces the proportion of Ar in the sputtering chamber (since the Ar flow rate is fixed (20 sccm)). Consequently, the number of Ar ion collisions also reduces, and therefore the coating thickness should be increased. In fact, however, the coating thickness is significantly reduced. Thus, a higher nitrogen flow rate is inferred to result in target poisoning. The thickness of all the coatings increases after annealing due to the formation of an oxide layer on the coating surface at elevated temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2, the oxygen content of the HN0 and HN10 coatings is significantly higher than that of the N0 and N10 coatings, and thus the coating thickness increases more significantly. However, there is only a small change in the oxygen content of the HN15 and HN20 coatings (i.e., minimal oxidation occurs during annealing), and hence the coating thickness shows only a small increase",

Mechanical properties The hardness values and adhesion strengths of all the coatings are listed in Table 3. For the as-deposited coatings, the hardness increases from 15.6 GPa to 24.6 GPa as the nitrogen flow rate increases from 0 to 15 sccm.

The higher hardness can be attributed to the formation of a greater number of hard nitrides and the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the matrix, which enhances the solid-solution strengthening effect [38]. However, the hardness of the N20 coating, prepared using the maximum nitrogen flow rate, reduces very slightly to 24.2 GPa. Ac\u00ad cording to Ref. [22], a nitride layer is formed on the surface of the alloy target as the nitrogen flow rate increases, which changes the reactive sputtering process in the chamber to direct nitride sputtering and de\u00ad creases the coating hardness accordingly. Nonetheless, all the annealed coatings have a higher hardness than the as-deposited coatings owing to the increased crystallinity of the coating structure. In addition, the coatings become denser after annealing, as shown in Fig. 3. Moreover, annealing enhances the overall bonding strength between the target elements and the nitrogen because of the greater thermal energy pro\u00ad vided at elevated temperatures [39]. Thus, even the HN0 and HN10 coatings, which have an amorphous structure in the as-deposited con\u00ad dition show much improved hardness values of 20.7 GPa and 29.3 GPa after the annealing process. Similarly, the hardness values of the HN15 and HN20 coatings increase to 31.6 GPa and 33.2 GPa, respectively. The XPS results showed the presence of Al2O3, Cr2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, Fig. 5.

The greater adhesion strength of the coatings with a higher ni\u00ad trogen content can be attributed to the change in the coating structure from amorphous to FCC, in which the grain boundaries help resist plastic deformation [41]. The authors in Ref. [42] reported that coatings with a higher H/E ratio (i.e., hardness to elastic modulus ratio) can absorb more elastic energy before fracture failure.

The N15 and N20 coatings, both without V2O5 solid lubricant, show a lower and more stable friction coefficient, which suggests that only minimal adhesion wear takes place during sliding. Nonetheless, the abrasive, oxidative, and adhesive wear of the wear pairs during the sliding process induces a large surface height difference, which causes the friction coefficient to fluctuate as the sliding process proceeds.

In a previous study by the present group [32], a Si3N4 ball with high hardness (14 GPa) was used as the counterbody in sliding tests against WC and HWC substrates. The wear rates of the substrates were almost identical. Thus, it was inferred that the HWC substrate had good thermal stability and wear resistance under the same heat treatment conditions.

(Note that for convenience in the following discussions, an O content greater than 40 at.% is defined as severe oxidation, an O content less than 20 at.% is defined as mild oxidation and an O content between 20 at.% and 40 at.% is defined as moderate oxidation.) Region B (black block and ribbon regions) consists mainly of C (52.2 at.%), W (27.8 at.5), and O (16.1 at.%). The low ox\u00ad ygen content indicates that Region B suffers only mild oxidation wear. Thus, overall, the wear mechanism of the WC substrate is determined to be slight abrasion wear and severe oxidation wear. Fig. 10(b) shows the wear track on the HWC substrate. The track contains",

In other words, the wear scar penetrates the underlying substrate, and hence the C element of the WC substrate is detected in the wear track. Overall, the N0 coating has poor tribological properties because of its low adhesion strength (Lc = 55.6 N), hardness (15.6 GPa), and H/E ratio (0.038). Fig. 11(b) shows the wear track on the N15 coating. Region C (black smooth area) has a high N content of 51.2 at.%, and the contents of the other metal elements are all very close to those of the original coating.

For an isolated spherical pore, the applied tensile stress is amplified by a factor of 2 [48]. Hence, the tensile strength and stiffness of the foam structure declines as porosity increases. Fig. 2.

Similar deformation behavior was observed for all the modeled HEA systems at different temperatures and atom distributions (see Fig. S2 and Fig. S3). A three-stage phenomenon was noted. In stage I, a linear rise in tensile strength is observed i.e., at lower strains (\u03b5 < 0.02). A nonlinear increase in stress with strain at higher strain values was recorded in stage II which was followed by a final sharp stress drop in stage III. The three stages correspond to elas\u00ad ticity, plasticity, and fracture, respectively.

The resulting thermal atomic motion causes the atoms to occupy a larger volume, and the interatomic distance between the nearest neighbors increases. The probability of finding atoms at a given distance decreases as the inter\u00ad atomic distance increases. The height of the peaks in the RDF plots are consequently reduced. In addition, the bond energy between atoms generally decreases as interatomic distance increases. Thus, the thermal atomic motion also weakens the bonds between the atoms, which further decreases the height of the peaks. This is because the attractive force between atoms decreases with increasing distance, which leads to a decrease in potential energy. Subsequently, relatively lower peaks are observed at high temperatures due to the increased interatomic distance and weakening of bonds between the atoms. As",

As the temperature increased, the percentage elongation after fracture increased.

Although the yield stress under RT was slightly higher than that under 340 \u25e6C, it could not be considered that the yield stress under RT was lower than that under 340 \u25e6C. Such minor differences might be caused by uneven zeroing of the force sensors.

With the augment of Ti content, the volume fraction of the petal-like new phase first increased and then reduced, which was consistent with the XRD analysis results (Fig. 1).

It can be found that the hardness was positively correlated with the mass fraction of BCC phase. Roughly, the relation\u00ad ship between Vickers hardness and BCC phase mass fraction can be expressed as HV = 10.437379 MBCC + 162.7614574, where HV and MBCC were the value of Vickers hardness and mass fraction of BCC phase (%), respectively. On the one hand, the increase of mass fraction of hard BCC phase can result in the increase of Vickers hardness. As manifested by the previous studies [36,37], the increment of the hardness was attributed to the precipitation of a large number BCC phase. On the other hand, the grain refinement of the alloy resulted in grain boundary strengthening [38], which led to the increase of hardness value of the alloy. The grain size of Ti0 alloy was significantly larger than other alloys, which was part of the reason for the minimum hardness of the alloy. The Fe2Ti phase, as an intermetallic compound, had a negative effect on the hardness of the alloy, which can be confirmed by increasing the x value from 0.8 to 1, increasing the Fe2Ti phase mass fraction in the alloy from 9.42% to 13.36%, but decreasing the alloy hardness",

By increasing Ti element content of the largest radius atom in FeCrNiCuTix alloys, the movement of atoms in the alloy was inhibited, thus triggering the solid solution strengthening and pinning effect [40], so as to optimize the mechanical properties of the alloys. Meantime, the second phase strengthening effect caused by the precipitation of BCC phase would also enhance the strength of the alloy. As the value of x varied from 0 to 0.4, the strength increase might be caused by the strengthening effect of solid solution and second phase.

When x = 0.4, the average friction coefficient of the alloy reached the minimum value of 0.47. At x \u22650.4, the wear quality of alloys decreased significantly with less than or equal to 0.7 mg. The wear rate of the alloy can be based on the formula (2), Wr = \u0394V/(L \u2022 F) (2) where Wr, \u0394V, L and F are the wear rate of the alloy, the volume wear of the material, the total sliding distance of the dual ball during friction and the load applied to the surface of the sample. Among, the \u0394V can be calculated by the density formula, L = 1.764 m and F = 10 N according to the experimental conditions. The calculation results were also pre\u00ad sented in Table 8. Similarly, the wear rate of the alloy was significantly reduced after adding Ti element. At x \u22650.2, the wear rate was reduced by an order of magnitude to the order of 10\u22126, so there was not much difference between them. These results represented that the wear resistance of the alloy had been greatly improved. In general, the alloys with high strength and hardness exhibit good wear resistance [44].

The SEM images of worn surfaces of FeCrNiCuTix alloys (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) were displayed in Fig. 14. It can be seen that a large number of furrows and abrasive chips were distributed along the sliding direction of the abrasive surface of the alloy. The wear characteristics of alloys wear surface, such as furrow and wear chips, were mainly caused by the continuous ploughing of the dual Si3N4 ball during the friction process, which was a typical wear particle wear form. The wear marks on the surface of Ti0 alloy were wide and deep. After the incorporation of Ti element, the wear traces became significantly narrower and shal\u00ad lower, and the wear chips were decreased, further indicating that the wear resistance of the alloy had been improved. 4. Conclusions In this study, the effects of doping Ti element on the microstructures and mechanical properties of FeCrNiCuTix high entropy alloys were examined in as-cast condition.

This is attrib\u00ad uted to the fact that at RN = 13%, the crystalline structure of the HEAN films starts to undergo a transition from mainly FCC crystal structure to a mixed constitution of amorphous and nanocrystals. Fig. 8b gives the hardness and elastic modulus of HEAN films at different RN. The Al0.5CoCrFeNi metallic film shows hardness and modulus of 11.63 GPa and 175.7 GPa, respectively. These values increase to 13.07 GPa and 210.6 GPa for HEAN film at RN = 6%, indicating the solution strengthen of nitrogen. The maximum hardness and modulus are observed at RN = 23%(14.42 GPa and 212 GPa), much higher than the Al0.5CoCrFeNi film (11.63 GPa and 175.7 GPa).

However, Obviously, the HEAN film at RN = 23% shows highest H3/E2 (0.067) and H/E ratio (0.068) with relative high \u03b7p ratio (0.62), indicating superior toughness. Actually, the as-deposited Al0.5CoCrFeNi film shows much higher hardness (11.63 GPa) than the melted Al0.5CoCrFeNi HEA (<5 GPa, [23, 25]). This is mainly attributed to the refinement of grains. With the addition of N atoms (RN =6%), the further refinement of grains and solid solution of N in HEA lattice contribute to the hardness increase. How\u00ad ever, at RN = 13%, the amorphous structure become apparent in the HEAN film, thus leading to the hardness decrease. As described in TEM (Fig. 7), the HEAN film at RN = 23% show a structure of amorphous embedding nanocrystals, thus leading to a significant increase in hard\u00ad ness. With further increasing RN, more N atoms are incorporated into the interstitial sites, inducing a reduction in the grain size (Fig. 4) and an increase in lattice distortion. In addition, the continuous bombardment of ions during sputtering makes the film structure denser (Fig. 3). Solid solution strengthening, fine grain strengthening and dense structure synergistically enhanced the properties of the films, contributing to the highest hardness at RN = 23%.

This con\u00ad version not only leads to a decrease in the deposition rate of the film (Fig. 1a), but also leading to a slight decrease in mechanical properties.

With increasing RN (>13%), the films form a uniform amorphous phase with lower defect concentration and higher chemical homogeneity, which slows down the diffusion of chloride ions and thus enhancing the corrosion resistance of the films [44]. Addi\u00ad tionally, the film with RN = 23% displayed no significant pitting po\u00ad tential observed in the scan range and showed significant resistance to chloride ion penetration and pitting. Therefore, the film with RN = 23% demonstrates the best corrosion resistance. The EIS results of 304SS and HEAN films are presented in Fig. 12. As seen from Fig. 12a, the Nyquist curves reveal that both the films and 304SS display similar capacitive arc at low frequencies and linear characteristics at high frequencies. Typically, a larger radius of the capacitance arc in the Nyquist curve implies a higher impedance and better resistance to corrosion [45]. As reported by Zheng et al. [40], the amorphous with homogeneous microstructure and no localized hetero\u00ad geneous defects would enhance the corrosion resistance. Notably, the HEAN films exhibit a significantly larger capacitive arc radius than 304SS, indicating enhanced corrosion resistance. In addition, at RN = 23%, the film is dominated by an amorphous structure exhibits the largest capacitive arc radius, suggesting the highest level of corrosion resistance. Generally, the polarization resistance expressed in |Z|0.01 Hz is a useful measure of reaction corrosion resistance,",

The corrosion-resistant elements such as Al and Cr in the films facilitate the formation of a dense oxide film. Also, the film shifts to an amorphous structure with increasing RN, leading to an in\u00ad crease in charge transfer resistance [47]. Meanwhile, the higher RN contribute to a more compact structure (Fig. 6), reducing flaws in the film [48]. This hinders the intrusion of corrosive media and enhances the corrosion resistance of the film.

Generally, the smaller ductile dimple possesses higher strength when the alloy exhibits similar plasticity levels [26,31].

Some researchers have explained that the increase of the stress-strain curves are due to work hardening, and the decreases are attributed to dynamic recrystallization [52]. The yield strengths of the Mo5 sample are 208 \u00b1 7, 96 \u00b1 5, and 65 \u00b1 4 MPa at 1173, 1273 and 1373 K, respectively. Meanwhile, the fracture strains of the Mo5 sample are greater than 60 % at the three temperatures. This ensures the excellent deformability of the RHEAs. The Mo5 RHEA ex\u00ad hibits high mechanical performance combined with low density prop\u00ad erty (6.56 g/cm3). The specific yield strength of the Mo5 specimen is compared with other RHEAs, as shown in Fig. 7b. The relatively high specific yield strength of the Mo5 RHEA indicates that it may be have a wider potential for industrial applications. Fig. 4.

A higher \u03b4A value correlates with better plasticity [20]. It needs to be explained here that the \u03b4A value of the Mo7 sample does not contradictory to the tensile experimental result. This is because the plastic factor mainly reflects the BCC crystal, while the plasticity mainly depends on the grain boundary [55]. Moreover, the pop-in phenomena can be observed in the P-h curves (Fig. 8a). Pop-in is the starting point where the crystal begins to yield, and the initial stage of the P-h curve follows the Hertzian elastic theory [56]. P = 4 3ErR 1 2h 3 2 (17) Fig. 5.

Al, Ti, and Zr were in the third quadrant, suggesting that they are segregated elements in the final stage of solidification, chiefly distributed in the dendrites. These points were linearly fitted to derive the dotted line in the graph. With increased Al content, the slope of the fitted line became higher, indicating that Al addition increased the segregation degree of elements in the alloy. Bright field (BF) images of Al0 high-entropy alloy TEM and the corresponding selective electron diffraction pattern showed that the microscopic topography of the alloy possessed characteristics si\u00ad milar to that of dendrites in Fig. 3 (Fig. 6a). Based on the selected electron diffraction patterns (Fig. 6c and 6d), the two were phases BCC1 and BCC2, respectively, which coincided with the XRD analysis in Fig. 2. Dark field (DF) images allowed clear observation of the position relationship between the two phases (Fig. 6b). The dendrite part was BCC1 phase and the intergranular part BCC2 phase. TEM characterization of Al0.1 and Al0.5 alloys showed that, after Al addition, there was no pronounced change in the morphology of BCC1 and BCC2 phases in the matrix (Fig. 7). However, the generation of spherical precipitated phases was observed due to the fact that Al was prone to reaction with Zr in BCC2 phase. In Al0.5 alloy,",

After Al addition, the yield strength in\u00ad creased, while the Young\u2019s modulus of the alloy also increased. The relationship between yield strength and plastic strain of high-en\u00ad tropy alloy was observed and the strength found to increase while the plasticity decreased (Fig. 8b). In addition, yield strength and plastic strain appeared to have a linear relationship with Al content. For each 0.1 mol increase in Al content, the yield strength increased by 127 MPa and plastic strain decreased by 4.92 %. When Al content increased to 0.5 mol, the plastic strain of the material was reduced to 10.2 %, indicating that the addition of excess Al worsened plasticity at room temperature. The reasons for the increase in yield strength of materials will be discussed in detail in Section 4.2. High-temperature compressive stress-strain curves of Alx (TiZrTa0.7NbMo) series alloys are shown in Fig. 9 and the relevant high-temperature mechanical properties in Table 3.

At this time, the contributions to solution strengthening of Al0, Al0.1, and Al0.5 alloys were calculated quantitatively, with the calculated results at 267 MPa,261.61 MPa and 244 MPa, respectively.

[11,28], WMoTaNb RHEA has the hardness, compressive yield strength, UCS, and ductility of 460 HV, 1058 MPa, 1211 MPa, and 2.1 %, respectively. Compared to these previously conducted researches, it is obvious that the mechanical properties herein possess a consider\u00ad able improvement. The elastic modulus of the as-built WMoTaNbNiTi RHEA at a scanning rate of 1.1 m/s is 240 \u00b1 7 GPa, a little higher than 220 \u00b1 20 GPa of WMoTaNb RHEA [11]. Results of the nanoindentation experiment show a measured maximum depth (hmax) of 145 \u00b1 6 nm, a residual depth (hr) of 97 \u00b1 9 nm after unloading, and a nanoscale ductility of 0.67 \u00b1 0.09, which promises better local coordination in deformation of adjacent regions near grain boundaries. In addition, all the as-built WMoTaNbNiTi RHEAs have a significant steady-state strain hardening before approaching UCS or even fracture with a strain-hardening coefficient of the engineering stress-strain curves (\u03b3 (\u0394\u03c3/\u0394\u03b4), \u03b4 denotes the ductility) which is estimated to be 5.17 GPa. The engineering stress-strain curve of compression test at 1200 \u25e6C suggests an excellent thermal resistance of the as-built WMoTaNbNiTi RHEA formed at scanning rate of 1.1 m/s (see Fig. 11). The UCS and DBF of the as-built WMoTaNbNiTi RHEA are 738 MPa and 17.4 % (UCS in work of WMoTaNb RHEA by Senkov and coworkers [11] at 1200 \u25e6C is 803 MPa).

Therefore, it can be taken for granted that the formation of this serious deformed structure (sometimes stacking fault) in Ni-constituted alloys [32,68,75,76] can be another way to alleviate residual stresses in the as-built WMoTaNbNiTi RHEAs. Furthermore, the temperature preheated up to 1100 \u25e6C and the stable temperature preservation above 850 \u25e6C during the whole melting pro\u00ad cess have helped ensure a lowered cracking susceptibility in the as-built WMoTaNbNiTi RHEAs [77]. 4.2. Strengthening mechanism The lower the linear energy density values, the smaller and shallower the melting pool sizes, as well as the lower the thermal gradients. In detail, a smaller and shallower melting pool induces fewer heat-affected areas, which thus promises lower thermal gradients and a more rapid cooling rate, leading to fewer chances for grain growth. Meanwhile, the reduction of vaporized amounts of these elements, e.g., Nb, Ni, and Ti, caused by the dropping linear energy density values can effectively accelerate the generation of more precipitates (this will be discussed later), and eventually contribute to a stronger solid-solution",

Deformed microstructures To reveal the difference of deformed microstructures between these alloys, SEM\u2013EBSD observations were conducted on the tensile samples that were strained to a total strain of ~11 %. Fig. 3 presents EBSD orientation-maps (OMs), Kernel average misorientation (KAM) maps and geometry necessary dislocation (GND) maps of the tensile samples of the alloys. KAM is defined as the average misorientation between each measurement point and all immediate neighbors, which induces lattice curvature [30]. During plastic deformation, stored dislocations can be divided into two classes termed statistically stored dislocations (SSDs) and geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs), respectively [31,32]. SSDs, resulting from the random trapping of mobile dislocations, are homogeneously distributed within materials and can convert to GNDs in further deformation. GNDs have a net non-zero Burgers vector and contribute to the lattice curvature that can be estimated by KAM characterization under EBSD. In general, most stored dislocations in a severe deformation can be considered as GNDs which accommodate long-range strain gradient [32]. From Fig. 3, it is seen that GNDs featured a low density within the coarse grains, concentrating mainly near grain boundaries in the E-M alloy (Fig. 3 (a)). The average density \u03c1 of GNDs in the E-M alloy was 2.08 \u00d7 1014 (1/m2). In the other alloys with smaller grain size, GNDs expanded into the interior of grains in addition to concentrating near grain boundaries. With similar grain sizes, alloys E-Ni2 (Fig. 3 (b)), E-",

It can be seen that the calculated results of the yield strength are basically in line with the experimental results, with a certain deviation. The result given by the Varvenne model has a slight higher accuracy than that given by the Senkov model. The strengthening effect is mainly contributed by the grain refinement. The lattice resistance \u03c30 and solid-solution strengthening \u0394\u03c3ss vary slightly in the different alloys. The difference is limited due to the fact that the atomic radius mismatch/the misfit volume, Burgers vector magnitude, shear modulus and shear modulus mismatch are quite similar in the different alloys. This indicates that adjusting elemental proportions in the solid-solution is inefficient for strengthening this kind of alloys. Grain refinement is a significant pathway to enhance the alloys. Nevertheless, adjusting elemental proportions can lead to a significant impact on the strain hardening rate. Fig. 7.

Based on the normalized data, three groups of differential value series can be obtained by \u0394X(0) i\u22121(j) = \u20d2 \u20d2 \u20d2X(0) 1 (j)-X(0) i (j)| (i = 2, 3, 4) (8b) Consequently, the correlation coefficient of parameters with ductility can be estimated by \u03b5i-1(j) = \u0394(min) + \u03c3 \u0394X(0) i\u22121(j) + \u03c3 (9b) where \u0394 (min) = min {\u0394Xi-1(min) } , \u0394Xi-1 (min) = min\uff5b\u0394X(0) i\u22121(j)\uff5d; \u03c3 = 0.5\u0394(max), \u0394 (max) = max{\u0394Xi-1(max)}\uff0c \u0394Xi-1 (max) = max \uff5b\u0394X(0) i\u22121(j)\uff5d. Finally, the grey correlation degree can be determined by ri-1 = 1 n \u2211 n j=1 \u03b5i-1(j) (n = 13) (10b) The grey correlation degree is a measure of the influence of various parameters on the ductility. The calculated grey correlation degree of d, h and a is 0.52, 0.75 and 0.70, respectively. The correlation order is rh > ra > rd.",

Therefore, Co-enrichment could be more favorable for the strength-ductility enhancement of the solid-solution matrix in Ni\u2013Fe\u2013Co\u2013Cr HEAs with high strain hardening rate and small activated volume. 5. Conclusions (1) The recrystallization progresses more slowly in the NiFeCo2Cr alloy than in the E-M, E-Ni2 and E-Fe2 alloys. Under the same heat treatment condition, the NiFeCo2Cr alloy exhibits finer grains. The recrystallization process is the fastest in the Ni2Fe\u00ad CoCr alloy. (2) Adjusting the elemental proportions in Ni\u2013Fe\u2013Co\u2013Cr HEAs for strengthening is inefficient, because the solid-solution strength\u00ad ening by atomic radius mismatch/the misfit volume, Burgers vector magnitude, shear modulus, and shear modulus mismatch is quite similar in the different molar ratio alloys. The strength\u00ad ening of the alloys mainly depends on grain refinement. (3) The strain hardening rate has the dominant influence on the ductility of the alloys. The NiFeCo2Cr and",

The equilibrium phases of the bulk HEAs were calculated by Thermo-Calc using the TCNI9 database, the results of which are plotted in Fig. 3. It can be seen that CoCrFeNi remains a single FCC phase in the temperature range from 600 to 1300 \u25e6C (Fig. 3a). With the addition of Ti, the equilibrium phases contain \u03b7-Ni3Ti, \u03c3, and ordered phases (Fig. 3b,c), which confirm the feasibility of introducing phase engineering by mixing Ti with CoCrFeNi powders and post-heat treatment.

The addition of Mo also increased the phase stability of LRHEAs at 500 \u25e6C. In addition, we investigated the high-temperature properties, as well as analyzed the phase stability and solid solution strengthening mechanisms. 2. Experimental The M0 and M7 LRHEAs ingots were prepared by vacuum suspension melting furnace in argon atmosphere using high-purity (99.95 wt%) Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Al and Mo. Before melting, the metal monomers were me\u00ad chanically polished and ultrasonically cleaned to remove oxide skin and other impurities on their surfaces. The ingots were repeatedly melted four times to ensure a uniform composition. Afterward, all the ingots were sealed in a quartz tube filled with argon, and homogenized at 1150 \u25e6C for 2 h followed by water quenching. Then, to address the issue of large ingots spending more time in the 400\u2013600 \u25e6C temperature range due to slower cooling rates and resulting precipitated phases, we con\u00ad ducted an aging treatment with a 5-h hold at 500 \u25e6C to study the effect of Mo on the phase stability of the alloy in the mid-temperature range.

From the stress-strain curves of the homogenized samples in Fig. 3(a), it can be seen that the addition of Mo element to LRHEAs enhances the strength and ductility.

The calculated results are plotted in Fig. 9(b), it is clearly seen that the strengthening effects of M0 and M7 alloys relying on atomic mismatches are similar, whereas the strength\u00ad ening effect of M7 alloy relying on shear modulus mismatch is more than three times that of M0 alloy. The shear modulus mismatch of the M0 alloy provides only ~180 MPa of strength, which accounts for ~26 % of the total strength. In contrast, the shear modulus mismatch of the M7 alloy provides ~564 MPa of strength, which accounts for ~57 % of the total strength. Therefore, the increase in yield strength with the addition of Mo element in LRHEAs is mainly dominated by the solid solution strengthening caused by shear modulus mismatch. To reaffirm the contribution of each element to the atomic and modal mismatches, and to exhibit the distinctiveness of Mo elements to the modal mismatches, we generated line plots for normalized \u03b4ri and \u03b4Gi values of each element. \u03b4rAl has the highest value in M0 and M7 alloys (Fig. 10(a)), indicating that Al contributes the most to atomic radius mismatch compared to other elements due to the smallest atomic radius of Al atoms. The addition of Mo atoms does not significantly contribute to atomic radius mismatch, therefore providing further evidence that solid solution strengthening of LRHEAs with added Mo elements is not achieved through atomic adaptation.

According to transition state theory (Vineyard, 1957), the plastic strain rate \u02d9 \u03b3 is related to the activation barrier by \u02d9 \u03b3 = \u02d9 \u03b30exp[ \u2212 \u0394H(\u03c4) /kBT], where \u02d9 \u03b30 is the reference strain rate and \u0394H(\u03c4) is the activation barrier as a function of shear stress. Therefore, the temperature-dependent stress originating from the screw dislocation kink-pair nucleation is \u03c4s = \u03c4s0 [ 1 \u2212 ( kT \u0394Hs0 ln \u02d9 \u03b3s0 \u02d9 \u03b3 ) 1 ps ] 1 qs , (19) where the reference plastic strain rate \u02d9 \u03b3s0 is taken to be 3.17\u00d7107 s\u22121 (Narayanan et al., 2014). Similarly, the resistance attributed to edge dislocation motion is \u03c4e = \u03c4e0 [ 1 \u2212 ( kT \u0394He0 ln \u02d9 \u03b3e0 \u02d9 \u03b3 ) 1 qe ] 1 pe , (20) where pe = 1 and qe = 1.5, supposing a sinusoidal activation barrier (Maresca and Curtin, 2020).

Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 187 (2024) 105640 13 We perform crystal plasticity simulations of uniaxial compression of NbMoTaW by incorporating the equations above into ABA\u00ad QUS/Explicit as a user material subroutine VUMAT. The polycrystal model of NbMoTaW is taken as an assembly of 8000 grains with random orientations, each grain represented by an element with reduced integration (C3D8R). The strain rate sensitive factor m is 0.05 (Hill and Rice, 1972; Terentyev et al., 2015). The grain size d is set at 200 \u03bcm (Senkov et al., 2011) and the initial dislocation density \u03c1 is 1 \u00d7 1013m\u22122 (Argon, 2008). The line-tension parameter \u03b7 is 0.5. The temperature dependence of the single crystal elastic constants are determined by measuring the change in the average stress tensor in an NVT simulations when the supercell undergoes finite defor\u00ad mation (Zhen and Chu, 2012). At 0 K, C11, C12 and C44 are respectively 345 GPa, 143 GPa and 73 GPa, which align with the DFT results (Maresca and Curtin, 2020). Also, C11 decreases with increasing temperature, while C12 and C44 vary little with temperature. C11 is fitted using a quadratic function (Lowrie and Gonas, 1967) to be C11=342.28 + 6.99 \u00d7 10\u22122T - 2.23 \u00d7 10\u22125T 2. Other parameters are shown in Table 2.

        "input": "2. The predicted strain-stress relationships of NbMoTaW at 296 K and 873 K are shown in Fig. 14(a). The simulation results match well with experimental data (Senkov et al., 2011), though the stress drop due to the ambient temperature brittleness is not captured by our model. Fig. 14(b) shows the predicted yield strength. In the low-temperature region, the effect of screw dislocation is prominent, and the yield stress diminishes rapidly with increasing temperature due to the small activation volume of kink-pair nucleation, on the order of several b3. This indicates that the ambient temperature yield strength of NbMoTaW can be well predicted by the kink-pair nucleation mechanism of screw dislocations, while strengthening originating from screw dislocations does not predominate at high temperatures. Above 400 K, the yield strength is controlled by edge dislocations, changing slowly with temperature. The solid solution strengthening theory, as represented by Eqs. (21) and (22), predicts a large activation volume of edge dislocation glide. The larger activation volume of edge dislocation glide than that of screw dislocations is in line with the nano-pinning mechanism reported by Chen et al. (2020a), since the activation volume of nano-pinning is on the order of lb2, where l is the distance between pinning points and is much larger than b. However, the consideration of screw dislocation provides valuable insights into the lower-temperature behavior of BCC HEAs, and our methodology establishes a solid foundation for the atomistic determination of effective dislocation behavior in random so\u00ad lution solids. 5.

Additionally, prior MEAM potentials for analogous binary alloys are documented. It is worth noting that, due to both Ti and Zr having the \u2018HCP\u2019 configuration as a reference state, there were issues with reproducing the \ud835\udc352 elastic constant. An effort was made to adopt \u2018BCC\u2019 as a reference state for Ti and Zr, as per the work of Maisel et al. [17]. However, it was subsequently discovered that the inclusion of V as a dilute alloying element in a Ti matrix in previous MEAM potential Maisel et al. [17] rendered the potential unstable leading to a negative stacking-fault energy. The calculated elastic constants, \ud835\udc3611 and \ud835\udc3612, for the binary combinations were only 5% or less off from the DFT values. However, it is important to note that the value for \ud835\udc3644 did not match these calculations well. The new MEAM potential developed in this work shows much better agreement with DFT calculations compared to previous MEAM potentials [14,15], especially for elastic constants. The current MEAM potential has an RMSE of 11.34 versus DFT, while the previous MEAM potential had an RMSE of 111.09 for V-Nb, V-Ti, and V-Zr binaries, and an RMSE of 37.63 for Nb-Ta, Nb-Ti, Nb-Zr, Ta-Ti, Ta-Zr, Ti-Zr binaries, respectively. For formation enthalpies, both the new and old MEAM potentials have similar, low RMSE values around 0.02. For lattice constants, the RMSE is 0.01 for",

As previously stated, the target structure for the three-body terms is the \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a2 orthorhombic configuration, characterized by eight independent elastic constants. The MEAM potential reproduces all elastic constants with less than a 10% margin of error for any ternary combinations. It is imperative to mention that, in addition to elastic constants, the poten- tial is also fitted with target parameters such as stacking fault energies, vacancy formation energies, and free surface energies of binary alloys. Given that the MEAM potential formulation does not permit the fitting of four-body or five-body term combinations, it is critical to match all these the two- and three-body target parameters within with the database, there exists a reasonable likelihood of obtaining higher-order properties that approximate DFT or experimental behavior. 3.1.2. Elastic properties of special quasi-random structures To determine if the model can capture the random solid solutions found in RHEAs, special quasi-random structures (SQS) [30] were constructed using the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) [31] tool. SQS mimics the randomness of real alloys while using a periodic supercell. SQS models were built for the VNbTaTiZr 5-element RHEA and its 3- and 4-element subsystems. For the DFT calculations, BCC supercells were generated with dimensions of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 (54 atoms), 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 (128 atoms), and 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 (250 atoms) unit cells for the 3-, 4-, and 5-element alloys, respectively.

This provides confidence in utilizing the new potential for realistic modeling of intricate chemical configurations in RHEAs. 3.1.5. Lattice distortion in RHEA A recent investigation by Lee et al. [50] reveals that the VNbTaTiZr HEA exhibits higher yield strength and comparable plasticity when compared to VNbTaTi HEA. The increase in yield strength is analyzed concerning lattice distortion, employing a combination of theoreti- cal modeling, first-principles calculations, synchrotron X-ray/neutron diffraction, atom-probe tomography, and scanning transmission elec- tron microscopy techniques. These findings underscore the pivotal role of severe lattice distortion in affecting the strength of refractory HEAs. Theoretical calculations of the primary strengthening compo- nents suggest that the high strength observed in both the VNbTaTi and VNbTaTiZr HEAs is primarily attributed to lattice mismatch, rather than modulus mismatch [51]. Consequently, it can be inferred that solid-solution strengthening is primarily driven by the lattice-distortion effect. The incorporation of Zr efficiently induces a distorted lattice, resulting in substantially higher yield strength in the alloy compared to the VNbTaTi HEA.

While slight variations in absolute values may be attributed to temperature effects, the overall trend derived from the MEAM potential aligns notably well with observations from DFT and experimental studies. This provides strong validation for the develop- ment of the potential and underscores its efficacy in investigating the influence of Zr on the deformation mechanism of this RHEA. For a more in-depth mathematical understanding of the lattice distortion factor calculation, readers are encouraged to refer to the work by Lee et al. [50]. 3.2. Mechanical behavior 3.2.1. Deformation behavior in single crystal RHEA: Uniaxial strain tension The present MEAM potential for the RHEA system was rigorously validated under simulated mechanical loading conditions. This is cru- cial to ensure the potential accurately captures the alloy behavior under the high stresses and strains encountered during plastic deformation. The validation specifically involved uniaxial (strain) tension simula- tions to probe the mechanical response and deformation mechanisms in the RHEA, mainly the capability of the potential to reproduce deformation twinning under high strain rates.

An edge or a screw dislocation, characterized by a Burgers vector of \u20d7 \ud835\udc4f= (\ud835\udc4e0\u22152) {1 1 1}, was introduced at the center of the simulation cell [69,70]. This was accomplished by the ATOMMAN python package (the source code is accessible at https://github.com/usnistgov/atomman). For all Peierls stress calculations, MS simulations are conducted at 0K. The dislocation line was aligned with the \ud835\udc65-axis, and the \ud835\udc66\u2013\ud835\udc65plane was defined as the slip plane where the dislocation was positioned.

A progressive strain tensor, \ud835\udf00is applied, inducing a gradual deformation of the simulation cell from an initial cuboidal shape to a triclinic form. The non-zero shear strain component in the case of a screw dislocation is denoted as \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66, and as \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67for an edge dislocation.

In contrast, for refractory RHEAs with high solute concentrations, the required shear stress to move edge dislocations is large and compa- rable to the one for screw dislocations (see Table 8). Thus, it appears that edge dislocations contribute to the plastic deformation in these complex concentrated alloys. The high solute concentration leads to inhomogeneous distributions of locally ordered structures that can pin and influence the mobilities of both screw and edge dislocations [73, 74]. Importantly, previous studies have shown that, unlike screw, edge dislocations can relax into a wavy low-energy configuration, provid- ing barriers to thermally-activated glide of the edge dislocations over distances related to the characteristic lengths of the waviness [64].

[25,26]. \u0394Hmix was calculated by using a thermodynamic subregular model (Eq. 3) with the parameter \u03c9ij taken from Ref. [27]. Bracq et al. [28] have calculated the enthalpy of mixing for the equiatomic FeNiCoCr and FeNiCoCrMn HEAs, which values were \u22126.475 and \u22125.506 kJ/mol, respectively. Those reported values are consistent with the results calculated in the present paper by using a thermodynamic sub-regular model proposed by Takeuchi et al. [27], as the tendency is similar, and the discrepancy is within 1.3 kJ/mol. Therefore, the subregular model can be used for approximation of the enthalpy of mixing in our HEA systems without the need of extensive experimental data or extensive calculations.

SEM micrographs of the three HEAs in the as-polished and etched are presented in Fig. 3, which clearly depicts the typical dendrictic structure of all the alloys. In addition, the coarse dendrictic structure was observed for FeNiCoCr and FeNiCoCrMn alloys (Fig. 3a and b), while the finer one is obtained for FeNiCoCrCu (Fig. 3c), which could be due to the strong segregation of Cu to form Cu-enriched phase. For a better observation of element distribution in the dendrite arm (DA) and interdendritic region (IDR) appeared in the structure of each alloy, a more sensible WDS element mapping technique is used, noted that the polished samples without etching were analyzed. Fig. 4 presents quantitative WDS elemental color mapping images of analyzed areas by electron probe micro-analyzer of all as-cast alloys depicted in Fig. 3. The color scale bar on the right-hand-side of each map, which indicates the atomic percentage of the respective element, is differently adjusted to enhance the contrast from element segregation. The mosaic and the network features on the maps correspond to the dendrite arm (DA) and interdendritic region (IDR), respectively. The elemental color mapping images clearly show that all the three alloys have a dendritic structure with different degree of element segregation. For FeNiCoCr alloys, the DA is enriched in Fe and Co ele\u00ad ments meanwhile the IDR is enriched in Cr.

Despite the decrease in the density of the designed HEAs, the additions of Mn and Cu in FeNiCoCr system have presented enhancement in mechanical properties as shown in stress-strain curves and microhardness tests of Fig. 6. It reveals that the average Vickers microhardness values of FeNiCoCr, FeNiCoCrMn, and FeNiCoCrCu were determined to be 132.2, 137.2, and 145 HV, respectively (Fig. 6b-d). The higher hardness of FeNiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCrCu alloys compared to FeNiCoCr alloys may be attributed to the solid-solution-like strength\u00ad ening mechanism originated from the elastic interactions among the local stress fields of solute atoms and dislocations [25,33\u201335].

Corrosion parameters such as corrosion potential, Ecorr, and corrosion current density, jcorr, derived from Tafel curves are obtained in Table 4. In general, all the obtained HEAs have presented better corrosion resistance than a similar alloy produced by the 3D printing using selected laser melting (SLM) method. Thus, jcorr of the SLM HAE alloy was of 58.9 \u00b5A cm\u22122 [20], much higher than those reported in the present work. From Table 2, it can be observed that from thermodynamic point of view, FeNiCoCrMn tends to corrode more easily compared to the other two HEAs because of the more negative Ecorr. The same tendency re\u00ad mains from kinetic point of view since the larger jcorr of the three HEAs corresponds to FeNiCoCrMn. Moreover, FeNiCoCrCu alloy (with smaller jcorr value, 2.70 \u00b5Acm\u22122) slightly improves the corrosion resistance of FeNiCoCr (jcorr = 2.80 \u00b5Acm\u22122), while it decreases significantly in the case of FeNiCoCrMn (jcorr = 7.94 \u00b5Acm\u22122). This enhancement in corro\u00ad sion resistance of FeNiCoCrCu could be due to the two-passivation processes observed in the anodic branch of Fig. 8. Moreover, it is generally believed that the surface energy, \u03b3, of different crystallographic planes in FCC crystal such as HEAs follows the trend \u03b3(111) < \u03b3(100) < \u03b3(110) [48].

Thus, jcorr of the SLM HAE alloy was of 58.9 \u00b5A cm\u22122 [20], much higher than those reported in the present work. From Table 2, it can be observed that from thermodynamic point of view, FeNiCoCrMn tends to corrode more easily compared to the other two HEAs because of the more negative Ecorr.

Moreover, FeNiCoCrCu alloy (with smaller jcorr value, 2.70 \u00b5Acm\u22122) slightly improves the corrosion resistance of FeNiCoCr (jcorr = 2.80 \u00b5Acm\u22122), while it decreases significantly in the case of FeNiCoCrMn (jcorr = 7.94 \u00b5Acm\u22122).

It is important to note that FeNiNoCrCu has presented better catalytic ac\u00ad tivity than FeNiNoCr, which is reported in [49] to have a closer HER activity to Pt than its individual components.

Such features in microstructure and elemental inhomogeneity are similar to the previous literatures [13,14,16,17,25]. Moreover, with increasing Ta concentration, Ta is segregate at the dendrite arms, while Zr enriched at the interdendrite regions. In contrast, Ti, Nb, and Mo concentrations decreases in dendritic and interdendrite regions. Moreover, the concentration of Zr and Ta in the dentritic and interdentrite regions are almost unchanged with Ta con\u00ad centration (Fig. 9a-b). When Ti is replaced by Ta, the microstructure of the RHEAs changes from fine dendrite arms to coarse dendrite arms due to the enrichment of Ta in the dendritic phase. Moreover, as indicated in Supplemental Material Section 4 (in Fig. S1c) increasing the freezing temperature range with Ta concentration also leads to grain coarsening. According to lattice parameters of two BCC phases, dendritic and interdendrite regions are characterized as the BCC1 phase and BCC2 phase, respectively. The soluble degree of elements in the dendrite (Cdr) and interden\u00ad drite (Cid) matrix could be quantitively evaluated by the partition co\u00ad efficient (k = Cdr/Cid) [24].

Effect of replacement of Ta for Ti on elastic and mechanical properties As indicated in Section 3.4. with the increase of Ta concentration, the elastic constants of all the RHEAs increased. The single-crystal elastic constants of the BCC structure alloys are dependent on the number of valence electrons, which increases with the increase of valence electrons [66,67]. Lobzenko et al. [68] demonstrated that elastic constants de\u00ad creases when a higher valency element (Mo-group VI element) is substituted with a lower valency element (Zr-group IV element) due to the weaker metallic bonds. This hypothesis is consistent with current observations, as TixTa2-xNbZrMo alloys elastic constants increase due to the replacement of the lower valency element Ti (VEC-4) with the higher valency element (Ta). The polycrystalline elastic moduli (E, B, and G), hardness and strength of the alloys are closely related to their single-crystal elastic constants. By making smaller values of C11, C12, and C44 those properties can be lower [69]. Thus, VEC is directly related to these properties. Therefore, elastic moduli (E, B, and G), hardness and",

In such a case the RT yield strength of the RHEAs are given by the following equation: \u0394\u03c3 = (\u03c3y ) mix +\u0394\u03c3a +\u0394\u03c3\u03bc [24,60] where (\u03c3y ) mix is stress from the rule of mixtures, \u0394\u03c3a and \u0394\u03c3\u03bc are stress due to the lattice and modulus misfit respectively. The yield strength estimated from the contribution of the modulus misfit \u0394\u03c3\u03bc and lattice misfit \u0394\u03c3a are shown in Fig. 11c. It can be inferred that at RT, a contribution from \u0394\u03c3\u03bc greater than the \u0394\u03c3a, the result is consistent with the reported literature [13]. When Ti is replaced by Ta the \u0394\u03c3\u03bc and \u0394\u03c3a are increase however, an increasing trend is more for the \u0394\u03c3\u03bc due to the increases of modulus distortion. Consequently, the calculated \u03c3y values of TixTa2-xNbZrMo RHEAs are agrees well with the yield strength obtained from Vickers hardness within the 5% error [Fig. 11d]. Hence, it is evident that the substitution of Ta for Ti can significantly improve its mechanical properties. 4.4. Advantages of Ta-rich RHEA (Ti5Ta35(NbZrMo)20) over equiatomic RHEA As is well known, the essential properties for bearing surfaces are high hardness and stiffness to maintain good wear resistance.

Stability and phase prediction Guo et al. [33,34] and Yang [35] predicted respectively, the mechanism for the formation of BCC/FCC phase stability and solid solution in HEAs. According to the authors, the competition between enthalpy and entropy can be determined through the use of a unitless entity with the symbol, \u03a9 as depicted in Equation (1). This expression was employed to determine/predict the solid solution formation in the HEA developed. \u03a9 = Tm\u0394Smix \u0394Hmix (1) where the terms Tm represents the melting temperature, \u0394Smix represents the Mixing entropy and \u0394Hmix represents the mixing enthalpy. For solid solutions, the \u03a9 value needs to be greater than or equal to 1.10 (\u03a9 \u22651.10). Also, the atomic mismatch (\u03b4) between the elements that make up the HEA can be computed using the expression: \u03b4 = \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 \u2211 n i=1 (ci(1 \u2212ri/r))2 \u221a (2) where ci represents the ith element atomic ratio, ri represents the ith element radius and r represents the average atomic radius. To promote solid solution formation in HEAs, the atomic radii of the elements making up the HEA need to be similar or close, and the value of \u03b4 must be less",

The stability of the phases present in HEAs was predicted by adopting the valence electron concentration (VEC) expression given as: VEC = \u2211 n i=1 ci(VEC)i (6) According to the expression, VEC \u22658 indicates a stable FCC phase, VEC \u22646.87 indicates a stable BCC phase while both FCC and BCC phase is found when 6.87 < VEC < 8 [37\u201339]. Adopting the expression for VEC in Equation (6) and the other expressions (Equations (1), (2), (4) and (5)), the phase prediction and stability of the HEA used in this study were determined, and the summary of the obtained values are depicted in Table 4. 3.2. Microstructure Depicted in Fig. 3 are the SEM micrograph and the XRD pattern of the milled HEA powder particles. The SEM of the aluminium particles in Fig. 3(a) shows that the powder consists of smooth-surface spherical microparticles that are well-dispersed. A similar aluminium powder micrograph with well-dispersed microparticles was reported by Chen et al. [40]. From the SEM micrograph of the milled HEA shown in Fig. 3(b), it was observed that the powders are relatively uniform, though with a noticeable mixture of spherical, flat and potato-like shapes. A similar shape mixture or irregularity in HEA powder was reported by Yim et al.

The XRD pattern for the spark plasma sintered Al and HEA-reinforced Al matrix composites is depicted in Fig. 4(d). A slight detectable shift was observed in the XRD peak of the HEA-reinforced Al matrix. This shift is due to the induced stress and strain in the crystal lattice caused by the introduction of the HEA. The induced stress affects the interplanar spacing and, consequently, the XRD pattern. For the sintered aluminium, all the picks are aluminium. Thus, signifying the absence of noticeable contamination during the sintering process.

The main difference is re- \ufb02ected in shear modulus G and Young's modulus E, the disordered con\ufb01guration has less ability to resist shear strain and tensile deformation than the ordered B2 con\ufb01guration.

The calculating result of alloys' lat- tice constants and density which based on the \ufb01rst-principle method due to the different Ti or Cr contents is exhibited on Fig. 4a and b. Compared with other elements (Al,Cr,V,Nb), Ti owns the largest atomic radius and the lowest density except Al. With the increase of Ti content, the lattice constant of the alloy increases, leading to the decrease of density. The lattice constant of the alloy decreases and the density increases with the increase of Cr content since the density of Cr is the largest and the atomic radius is the smallest. Elastic constants usually determine the elastic properties of materials and directly re\ufb02ect the mechanical properties.

Dewangan, A. Sharma, H. Lee et al. Journal of Alloys and Compounds 958 (2023) 170359 3 Further addition of tungsten improved the hardness and elastic modulus in the HEAs. It is hypothesized that three significant factors, which play a significant role in the strengthening mechanism of any alloy, may have contributed jointly to the HEAs\u2019 high hardness: the grain size, grain boundary, and precipitate hardening [51,52]. Since the hardness of the different phases was investigated ex\u00ad tensively in the present study, a hardness distribution contour map could help understand the hardness range of present phases. Hence, a hardness distribution plot obtained for nine indents in a 30 \u00b5m \u00d7 30 \u00b5m array was prepared, and it is shown in Fig. 6. In the investigated HEAs, XRD analysis confirmed the existence of three phases: BCC (hard phase), FCC (soft phase) [53], and \u03c3 (very hard phase) [54] phases. On the basis of the significant characteristic of the phases, it could be concluded that the region in red and shown by dark color is harder because of the presence",

In addition, many high entropy alloys have also been pro\u00ad duced, indicating lightweight, and resistance against oxidation, wear, erosion and corrosion. Due to these properties, HEAs find wide appli\u00ad cation in distinct sectors [102\u2013104]. Hence, this paper aims to give an overview of the classification of HEA-based coating materials, fabrica\u00ad tion techniques, post-processing coatings, properties, applications and future scope, as summarized in Fig. 19. 2. HEAs based coatings & its classification The high entropy alloy coatings are classified into 3 categories as shown in Fig. 20. 2.1. Metallic HEA coatings These coatings consist of FeCoNiMnCr series elements, commonly termed Cantor-based alloys [49]. It consists of transition and refractory metals. These refractory HEAs are used for high-temperature applica\u00ad tions to reduce corrosion, wear, erosion and oxidation. Some examples of refractory HEAs are CrNbVZr, TaNbZrHf, TaMoNbW, TaNbCrMo se\u00ad ries etc. [105,106].

Ceramic HEA coatings These coatings consist of metal carbides and nitrides of transition elements and find wide applications in nuclear power plants owing to the coatings\u2019 high strength, anti-corrosion performance, and thermal stability [105,111].

In the next section, the mechanical and tribological properties of HEAs-based coatings are discussed. Multi-component and equiatomic metal components such as Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Mn, Al, Mo, and Ti make up HEAs. The configurational entropy of mixing elements in high entropy allots results in the formation of single or many solid solutions with the FCC or BCC structure. This breaks the \u201cone primary element\u201d design concept of conventional alloys. Thus, high entropy alloys generally offer excellent mechanical and tribological properties (high strength, ductility, wear resistance, corrosion/oxidation resistance etc.) [282,283]. Among distinct high entropy alloys, FeCoNiCrMn (HEAs) with face- centred cubic structures have great interest in high-temperature appli\u00ad cations, and cryogenic and wear resistance fields [284\u2013288]. Xiao et al. [289] investigated the tribological characteristics of FeCoNiCrMn coatings before and after annealing using plasma spray. The results showed that examined coatings offered high resistance against wear. However, this wear resistance can be enhanced by applying heat treat\u00ad ment on coatings. Various authors [290\u2013293] also reported that thermal sprayed CoNiCrMn coatings offered excellent tribological properties. Recently, Zhang et al. [292] deposited plasma sprayed CoNiCrMn composite coating reinforced by TiO2 and Al2O3 particles to investigate the microstructure, tribological and mechanical properties. The authors observed that the composite coatings had significantly enhanced the tribological properties compared to pure high entropy alloy coatings. This may be owing to the reinforcing particle",

        "input": "9. 5. Post processing of HEAs coatings Due to rapid cooling, severe matrix deformation, and phase shifts, several non-equilibrium phenomena occur during the manufacturing of high entropy alloy coatings. These changes may lead to reduced adhe\u00ad sion and result in the premature failure of the base material [158,314,315]. In addition, weak interfacial forces and other defects occur due to the development of voids caused by thermal stresses. This results in a decrease in the overall surface integrity and coating adhe\u00ad sion. As a result, to improve the adhesion and surface properties of HEA coatings, some post-processing techniques are used [316,317]. The commonly used post-processing techniques of HEA coatings are shown in Fig. 32. 5.1. Heat treatment The grain refinement of HEA coatings is influenced by heat treat\u00ad ments. Zhang et al. [318] \u201ceffectively refined grain and boundary misorientation transition by annealing in the laser rapid solidified 6FeNiCoCrAlTiSi multicomponent ferrous alloy coating. The abnormal microstructure refinement and grain boundary misorientation transition in the coating after annealing at 500 \u25e6C were investigated using electron backscatter diffraction. The microstructure of the coating, however, was predominantly made up of directionally solidified columnar grains with low-angle grain boundaries spread as networks before the annealing treatment. However, following annealing, the microhardness and pri\u00ad mary phase were determined to be nearly identical. With the grain boundary misorientation transitioning from low to high, the columnar grains transform into equiaxed refined grains. Fig. 33 indicates the cross- sectional microstructure of HEA coating (6FeNiCoCrAlTiSi) before and after annealing treatment. After",

This is attributed to their unique structure and composition, which allows for more efficient electron transfer and active site availability. (b) Improved Stability: HEAs often exhibit exceptional stability under harsh electrocatalytic conditions, such as high tempera\u00ad tures, acidic or alkaline environments, and reactive species. This stability is attributed to their high configurational entropy, which reduces the driving force for phase decomposition and segrega\u00ad tion. As a result, HEAs can maintain their structural integrity and catalytic activity over extended periods, even under demanding operating conditions [424\u2013426]. (c) Tunable Properties: The properties of HEAs can be precisely tailored by adjusting the composition and arrangement of their constituent elements. This versatility allows for the development of HEAs with specific properties that are optimized for different electrocatalytic applications. By varying the elemental ratios and types, HEAs can be fine-tuned to achieve desired catalytic activ\u00ad ity, selectivity, and stability [427,428]. (d) Synergistic Effects: The presence of multiple elements in HEAs can lead to synergistic effects that enhance their overall perfor\u00ad mance. These interactions can modify the electronic structure, lattice parameters, and surface properties of the alloy, leading to improved catalytic activity, stability, and resistance to poisoning [429\u2013431].

Bulk HEAs are widely used in distinct industries such as aerospace, automotive, energy, machining, moulding, soldering, mining, nuclear, thermal, and biomedical. Developing low-cost, lightweight, energy-efficient structure mate\u00ad rials that possess superior properties at high temperatures is the great interest to the researchers. Presently, the maximum service temperature of conventional nickel-based superalloys, which are mostly utilized in thermal power plants (boiler tubes), aero engines, and gas turbine en\u00ad gines, has reached approx. 80 % of their melting temperature [561]. Thus, these superalloys cannot fulfil the harsher service conditions, where the working temperature is very high. In addition, nickel-based superalloys are expensive and possess high densities. This problem can be solved using novel bulk eutectic high entropy alloys (EHEAs). Because the EHEAs combine the benefits of high entropy alloys and eutectic alloys [562,563]. These EHEAs also have a controlled, near- equilibrium microstructure that can withstand temperature fluctua\u00ad tions up to the eutectic reaction temperature. As a result, EHEAs [564,565] are ideal materials for high-temperature applications. Lu et al. [565] produced the first EHA (AlCoCrFeNi2.1) in 2014. After that, bulk eutectic high entropy alloys have attained a great global interest owing to their superior properties (ability to withstand high tempera\u00ad ture, strength and ductility) than traditional materials [566\u2013571]. Further, with the advancement of new technology, various researchers [572\u2013588] designed and investigated novel bulk eutectic high entropy alloys.

Recent advances in high-entropy alloys for 3D printing Due to the unique features of 3D printing technology, 3D printing of high entropy alloys is currently attracting significant attention from various businesses and academia. 3D printing can create complex ge\u00ad ometries with customizable material properties. In addition, freedom of design, waste minimization, mass customization, fast prototyping, etc., are the significant advantages of 3D printing technology [683]. The main methods of 3D technology include fusion deposition modelling (FDM), Inkjet printings, Powder bed fusion (PBF), Stereolithography (SLA), Laminated object manufacturing (LOM) and Direct energy deposition(DED) etc. Among these methods, PBF and DED have been greatly explored for the 3D printing of high-entropy alloy products [684]. 7.1. Direct energy deposition (DED) Direct energy deposition (DED) is the most popular and effective 3D printing process to create high-entropy alloy products. This method utilizes a laser, electric arc or electric beam to melt metals in the form of wires or powders upon deposition [653\u2013688]. In addition, DED can fabricate functionally graded high entropy alloys through in situ alloy\u00ad ing using elemental powders [689]. The schematic diagram of direct energy deposition (DED) for the fabrication of HEA products is shown in Fig. 40. Borkar et al. [689] examined the phases and microstructures of direct energy deposition printed graded AlxCrCuFeNi2 (0 \u2264x \u22641.5). Further, in another investigation, Borkar et al. [690] studied the mi\u00ad crostructures and phases of graded AlCoxCr1\u2212xFeNi (0 \u2264x \u22641) high entropy alloy products produced with DED. Then, the variation of both the",

The literature revealed that many research efforts are being made to develop high-entropy alloys for many structural applications. These high entropy alloys offered excellent strength, hardness, and high resistance against oxidation, corrosion and wear. However, high entropy alloys have not been explored for diverse applications. Even though recently, many novel high entropy alloys have been designed and studied. However, their tensile properties have rarely been explored. Instead, various authors only investigated the mechanical properties of HEAs/ HEAs coatings in terms of hardness or Fig. 41. \u201cMicrostructure of compositionally graded AlxCuCrFeNi2 high entropy alloy products fabricated by direct energy deposition (a).

For alloying of Mo, W and Re, it is interesting to note that the elastic constant of RHEAs increases with the increase of atomic number. But for Hf-alloying, its elastic constants significantly reduce, indicating that NbTaTiZrHf RHEA has lower resistance to external forces than other RHEAs. Furthermore, the experiment revealed that Hf-alloying can reduce RHEA strength, while alloying of Mo and W can enhance RHEAs strength [5,31,35]. Cauchy pressure can indicate material atomic bonding qualities and ductility, and C12 \u2013 C44 > 0 suggests metallic bonding [36]. For NbTaTiZrX RHEAs, their Cauchy pressure values are all greater than zero, predicting the presence of metallic bonding in RHEAs with certain ductility. Among them, the Cauchy pressure value for Re-alloying is markedly reduced, indicating that the ductility of NbTaTiZrRe RHEA is worse than other RHEAs. Elastic modulus is a crucial physical property that determines an object\u2019s ability to resist material deformation when subjected to stress. It is primarily characterized by three parameters: bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, and Young modulus E, which represent the alloy\u2019s resistance to bulk, shear, and elastic deformation, respectively. The higher elastic modulus corresponds to a greater deformation resistance [37]. Fig. 2 shows the bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young modulus, and hardness of NbTaTiZrX RHEAs calculated",

        "input": "S2, when multiple alloying el\u00ad ements are mixed in a nearly equal atomic ratio to form a single-phase solid solution structure, the lattice structure of RHEs inevitably un\u00ad dergoes distortion due to differences in atomic radii between the con\u00ad stituent atoms and mismatches in physical properties such as elastic modulus. After the addition of X, the trend of elastic modulus change of NbTaTiZrX RHEAs is consistent with the trend of elastic modulus value change of element X. For example, adding elements such as W and Re with larger bulk modulus and Young\u2019s modulus results in higher B and E values for RHEA, while adding elements such as Hf and V with smaller shear modulus results in lower G values. Re has the largest elastic modulus, and the addition of it to the NbTaTiZr RHEA makes NbTa\u00ad TiZrRe possess a larger elastic modulus than the other RHEAs. And lattice distortion can reduce the elastic modulus of materials [41], so adding Hf elements with the maximum radius results in RHEA having the smallest elastic modulus.

Results from the point scanning (Table 2) in\u00ad dicate that Cr, Co, Fe, and Ni exist in the FCC1 phase at similar atomic ratios, whereas the FCC2 phase is mostly composed of Cu and Ni.

Elements with equilibrium distribution coefficients less than 1 remain in the liquid phase during solidification, resulting in higher segregation. Conversely, elements with higher equilibrium partition coefficients are able to enter the solid phase during solidification, thus reducing the degree of segregation. Atomic diffusion is reduced in metals and alloys that are solidified under high pressure. This increases the solidification rate at the solideliquid interface, which improves the equilibrium distribution coefficient and lowers the degree of ele\u00ad ment segregation. 3.2.

We also observed a decreased Ecorr value and higher corrosion tendency with higher solidification pressure. Grain refinement causes an increase in the number of grain boundaries and initial passive film nucleation positions. Grain boundaries and dislocations can also act as a driving force for the growth of passive films. An increase in defect density can promote the formation of a denser passive film on the surface of the material, thereby reducing its corrosion rate and increasing its corrosion re\u00ad sistance.

After the initial linear stage of stress\u2013strain curves in Fig. 4, the stress increases up to different peaks and then drops. These stress peaks are known to be amplified due to the high strain rate generally employed in MD simulation, thus it is more meaningful to compare the average flow stress over a certain inelastic strain interval [16]. Fig. 5 shows the grain- size dependence of the average flow stress between 10 % and 20 % applied strain. It can be found that the average flow stress increases proportionally with reducing grain size up to a maximum value, satis\u00ad fying the HP strengthening relationship. Then the average flow stress decreases with the further reduction of grain size, which is an IHP softening relationship.

Besides, Cr addition can improve strength, creep resistance, oxidation resistance and hot corrosion resis\u00ad tance at high temperature [81]. The Ti of Zr can effectively reduce the density and improve the specific strength of RHEAs [82]. The addition of Nb can improve ductility of RHEAs, which is the most frequently used element, close to twice as much as Mo [83]. The most direct reason is that Nb has a higher melting point density ratio (288 \u25e6C g\u22121\u2022cm\u22123). Thus, the Nb-bearing HEAs show higher melting point and lower den\u00ad sity.

Summary and outlook As a widely used advanced structure material in high-temperature fields, refractory high entropy alloys have attracted much attention due to excellent high-temperature strength and phase stability. This paper has systematically reviewed the progress of refractory high- entropy alloys fabricated by powder metallurgy, including the prepa\u00ad ration techniques of pre-alloyed powder, powder densification and microstructure and property regulation. Although some progress has been made in recent years, many challenges to further improving the properties of powder metallurgy refractory high-entropy alloys and expanding their application fields are still faced, as follows. (1) Mechanical alloying is currently the most commonly used and favored method for preparing refractory high-entropy alloy powders. Although nanoscale pre-alloyed powder with uniform alloy composition can be obtained, it has a fatal shortcoming, that is, the milling process will inevitably produce C, N and O contamination even under argon protective atmosphere. The focus of subsequent studies may need to be devoted to completely avoiding or mitigating C, N and O contamination, thereby further improving the properties of refractory high-entropy alloys fabri\u00ad cated by powder metallurgy. (2) Powder metallurgy has significant advantages in the preparation of refractory high-entropy alloys. The prepared materials have advantages of uniform composition, fine structure and dispersed distribution of second phases, showing better microstructure and mechanical properties than melted alloys. However, the compo\u00ad sition design of powder metallurgy refractory high-entropy alloys needs to consider factors such as mutual solubility, mixing enthalpy",

Aiming to strike an optimal balance between computational resources and the pragmatic needs of the simulated HEAs structures, we constructed a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 supercell unit, encompassing a total of 128 atoms. The density functional theory calculations were performed through the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [35] functional for exchange- correlation potentials and ion-electron interactions within the general\u00ad ized gradient approximation (GGA) and using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [36,37].

We derived a series of elastic constants using the stress-strain method to ascertain the mechanical properties of the FeCrVTiSix HEAs system [38]. The prediction of mechanical performance, grounded in Hooke's law [39], has been effectively utilized for calculating the mechanical properties of diverse alloys. Within the BCC crystal structure, three in\u00ad dependent elastic constants (C11, C12, and C44) are required for the prediction of key mechanical properties: bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (E), Poisson ratio (\u03bd), Vickers hardness (Hv) and fracture toughness (KIC) [40\u201344]. The bulk modulus B can be expressed as: B = C11 + 2C12 3 (1) The shear modulus G can be expressed",

Conclusion In this study, we propose a strategy based on the regulation of the chemical microenvironment through valence electron concentration to overcome the \u201cstrength-ductility trade-off\u201d dilemma in HEAs coating, while simultaneously improving the strength and ductility of metallic materials. The strategy's efficacy was initially substantiated through density functional theory calculations followed by experimental verifi\u00ad cation. The main conclusions are as follows: 1. DFT calculations show that the regulation of the chemical microen\u00ad vironment of HEAs could change the mechanical and ductility properties. 2. The designed FeCrVTiSix alloys consistently exhibit a single BCC solid solution structure, which is characterized by good chemical stability and mechanical stability. 3. The addition of Si enhanced the mechanical properties of the alloy system, effectively overcoming the strength-ductility trade-off. Vickers hardness escalated from 2.16 GPa in Si0 to 7.97 GPa in Si2.0, nano-hardness from 3.80 GPa in Si0 to 8.56 GPa in Si2.0, and Young's modulus from 228 GPa in Si0 to 244 GPa in Si2.0.

Nano-hardness (Hn) and reduced elastic modulus (Er) qualitatively evaluate the wear resistance of carburized specimens, and the ratios Hn/Er (related to resistance to elastic strain damage) and Hn3/Er2 (indicating resistance to plastic deformation) can be used as parameters to describe wear resistance. Due to the precipitation hardening of the carbide precipitation phases M7C3 and M23C6 and the solid solution strengthening effect of the carbon atoms (Fig. 8(c)), the maximum hardness of the carburized surface was twice as high as that of the interior (Fig. 8(b)) and the ratios Hn/Er and Hn3/Er2 were also significantly higher on the surface than the matrix (Fig. 8(d)), resulting in a better wear resistance of the surface.

Due to the solid solution strengthening of interstitial carbon atoms and strain hardening caused by lattice expansion, the surface hardness increased significantly, reaching 1221 HV, which was approximately five times that of the matrix. The surface hardness and wear resistance of the high entropy alloy are closely related to the diffusion of carbon, the size and distribution of the carbide precipitation phase, etc. Li et al. [51] treated CuCoCrNiFeC HEA by solid carburizing method. After the carburizing treatment, the CrFe7C0.45 and M7C3 carbides precipitated on the matrix of the alloy. Due to diffusion strengthening, the surface hardness of the alloy can be increased by up to 50 % compared to the matrix. As the carbide density decreases, the hardness gradually decreases from the surface layer to the core. Sun [52] carried out solid carburizing treatment on CuCoCrNiFe HEA. It was found that the hardness and wear resistance of the alloy increased under the diffusion strengthening effect of M23C6 and",

Boriding treatment The boron penetration layer exhibits excellent wear resistance due to the hard borides and severe solid solution strengthening, resulting in a higher surface hardness and a larger thickness of the high hardening layer. Hou et al. [55] used solid boron penetration in Al0.25CoCrFeNi HEA to prepare a boron layer of approximately 50 \u03bcm thickness. Due to the larger thickness and harder hardness of the boron infiltrated layer, with severe solid solution strengthening, the hardness of the boron alloy was nearly 1136 HV, which was six times that of the borated alloy. The friction coefficient and wear rate of the un-borated alloy were 0.80 and 1.468 \u00d7 10\u22124 mm3/(N\u22c5m), while those of borated alloy were 0.53 and 1.25 \u00d7 10\u22125 mm3/(N\u22c5m), with twelve times the wear resistance of the un-borated alloy. Hu et al. [64] treated CoCrFeNiMn HEA by powder-pack boriding. Found CoCrFeNiMn HEA surface microhardness significantly increased to 23.8\u00b11.4Gpa, the friction coefficient was reduced from 0.86 to 0.48. Hou et al.

When the content of Mo added in the CoCrFeNi HEA is relatively low, the high mixing entropy effect brought by the multi-principal component effectively inhibits the phase separation, resulting in a single solid solution structure. Mo is dissolved in the lattice structure of the FCC matrix in the form of substitutional atoms, which increases the lattice distortion of the alloy due to its large atomic radius and thus strengthens the CoCrFeNi HEA. A further increase of Mo will promote the precipitation of hard and brittle topologically close-packed (TCP) phases: (Cr, Mo)-rich sigma (\u03c3) phase and (Mo, Cr)-rich mu (\u03bc) phase in the matrix [23,24]. The precipitation of such phases results in significantly enhanced hardness and strength through solution strengthening and precipitation strengthening mechanisms, which makes CoCrFeNiMo HEA alloy excellent wear-resistant material candi\u00ad dates [23,25].",

Compressed nitrogen was used as propelling gas, and the inlet pressure and temperature were kept at 5.0 MPa and 900 \u25e6C, respectively. A square Cu plate with a size of 100 mm \u00d7 100 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm was used as the substrate, and the substrate surface was ground with sandpaper prior to cold spraying to remove oxide film and improve adhesion strength, followed by cleaning with anhydrous ethanol. The standoff distance from the exit of the nozzle to the Cu substrate surface remained 40 mm during the deposition. The nozzle moving trajectory followed a recip\u00ad rocating zigzag strategy, and the space between two neighboring tracks was 1.0 mm. The deposits were subsequently processed into cubes (15 mm \u00d7 15 mm \u00d7 5 mm) by a wire-cutting electrical discharge machine (EDM, V400G, Excetek V400G, China) for the following wear-resistance property evaluation. To investigate the deposition behavior of CoCrFe\u00ad NiMox HEA particles, individual splat was deposited onto mirror- polished cold-sprayed CoCrFeNiMox HEA deposits under a nozzle traversal speed of 320 mm/s. The surface morphology of the single splat was characterized by SEM. 2.3. Microstructure Characterization The cross-sectional samples were mechanically ground and polished following metallurgical procedures for microstructure analysis. The density of the deposits was evaluated from optical microscopy (Leica DM LM, Germany) images using an image analysis method based on ASTM E2109-01 standard. The result was averaged from",

The working principle of the tribometer used for dry-sliding wear behavior investigation was provided in Fig. 7a. The ball remains stationary while the platform together with the spec\u00ad imen reciprocates along the x-direction during the test. Fig. 7b plots the COF evolution history of the CoCrFeNiMox HEA deposits. All the de\u00ad posits exhibit a running-in process (stage I) at the initial stage of the wear test [36], which is the result of contacting between micro-protrusions or asperities on the surface of the friction pair (i.e., GCr15 ball/CoCrFeNiMox HEA deposits). This two-body abrasion leads to a rapid increase in COF. In stage II, the COF fluctuated with time particularly for the Mo0 and Mo0.2 specimens. This could be associated with the material removal from the friction pair, suggesting the poor wear resistance of the deposits. As the friction proceeded, wear debris was peeled off from the deposit surface and piled up between the two contacting surfaces, and the contact modes changed from two-body abrasion to three-body abrasion. For the Mo0.5 deposit, the fluctuation of COF was significantly weakened at stage II, exhibiting a slow upward trend in the range of 0.3 and 0.4. This could be attributed to the enhanced hardness of the deposit. The COF of the Mo1.0 deposit",

For a more accurate description of the wear characteristic of the cold- sprayed CoCrFeNiMox HEA deposits, the specific wear rate (mm3/N\u22c5m) was calculated, as shown in Fig. 9b. The Mo0 deposit exhibits the worst wear resistance with a specific wear rate of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 mm3/N\u22c5m. The addition of Mo resulted in a gradual decrease in the specific wear rate of the deposits, and the wear rate was down by 17.4%, 80.6%, and 94.9% for the Mo0.2, Mo0.5, and Mo1.0 deposits. Table 3 summarizes the specific wear rate of CoCrFeNiMox HEAs fabricated by different manufacturing methods.

The peak strains of NbMoZrTi and NbMoZrTiV LRHEAs reached about 24.6% and 28.7% respectively, which were much higher than the peak strains of NbMoTaW RHEA. The experimental data are in good agreement with the calculations of elastic constants and modulus of elasticity. Fig. 19 shows the compression fracture morphology of NbMoTiZr- (Al/V) LRHEAs, the fracture morphology of the alloy did not find typical tough nests, the fractures are relatively flat, the fracture has many river- like patterns, which is a typical deconstructive fracture morphology, showing brittle fracture[51].

To confirm the reliability of the first-principle calculations. The as- cast NbMoTiZr-(Al/V) LRHEAs were prepared and analyzed for micro\u00ad structure and mechanical properties. The XRD data and microstructures demonstrate that the addition of the alloying element Al results in the presence of the B2 phase and the Zr5Al3 phase, except for the NbMoTiZr and NbMoTiZrV alloys, which have a single BCC solid solution structure. All four NbMoTiZr-(Al/V) LRHEAs are stronger and more ductile than NbMoTaW RHEA, with NbMoTiZr LRHEA having greater strength and NbMoTiZrV LRHEA having greater ductility. These results are in good agreement with the calculated results. Compared to NbMoTaW RHEA, this alloy system is effective in improving the mechanical properties and further reducing the alloy density. To examine alloy strengthening of LRHEAs and other alloys. The present work demonstrates that first- principle calculations are a viable tool for predicting the properties of LRHEA.

The elastic constants calculated using DFT indicate that the Cr15Cu5\u00ad Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA is elastically stable, satisfying all the stability conditions.

If the B/G ratio is greater than 1.75 and the Cauchy pressure is positive, the material exhibits ductility and metallic behavior [21]. The calculations show that the B/G ratio for the Cr15Cu5Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA is greater than 1.75, and the Cauchy pressure is positive, confirming its ductile and metallic nature.

However, alloys with higher ultimate tensile strengths often exhibit lower ductility, which is crucial in applications requiring a balance between strength and deformability. The Cr15Cu5Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA offers a compelling combination of strength and ductility, positioning it as a promising candidate for various engineering applications. Furthermore, the focus of this research is on the development of a Co- free HEA with an FCC structure, addressing cost constraints and broadening the range of available materials in this category. This unique aspect of the Cr15Cu5Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA composition, coupled with its competitive mechanical properties, adds to its significance in the field of high-entropy alloys. 3.4. Thermal properties The thermodynamic properties of the Cr15Cu5Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA were calculated using the Debye theory [58].

As it can be seen from Fig. 8- (b), The EDS analysis was conducted on the dendritic region of the microstructure. Finally, the fracture behavior of the Cr15Cu5Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA was examined. The tensile test fracture surface of the as-cast Cr15Cu5\u00ad Fe20Mn25Ni35 HEA exhibited ductile behavior, indicated by the presence of deep, equiaxed dimples on the fracture surface, as shown in Fig. 9. This indicates significant plastic deformation and slow tearing of the metal as cracks propagate. Examination of the sample surface revealed numerous equiaxed dimples on the fracture surface. In contrast, brittle fractures lack dimple formation and display smooth surfaces with min\u00ad imal plastic deformation and cleavage facets [77,78]. 4.

The crystal structure of the EHEA coating was tested by a Philips Xpert-Pro X-ray diffractometer (XRD), operating at 40 KV voltage, 40 mA current, and a scanning rate of 5\u25e6/min. A scanning electron micro\u00ad scope (SEM, FEI Quanta 200) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200x) were used to analyze the microstructure of the coatings. The elemental distribution of the coating was analyzed by an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The sizes of the lamellae were determined via the conventional mean-linear-intercept method from SEM images. The SEM image was processed using the Image Pro and the phase ratio was determined by chromogenic methods. The HV-1000A microhardness tester was used to measure the hard\u00ad ness of the coating cross-section with an applied load of 300 g and loaded for 15 s. Nano-mechanical properties of the coatings were analyzed using an Agilent G200 nano-indentation instrument. Each sample was tested 3 times to confirm the reliability of the results. Dry sliding friction experiments were carried out at room temperature (RT), 400 \u25e6C, and 800 \u25e6C for a duration of 60 min, using HT-1000 high-tem\u00ad perature friction and wear tester. The following tribological parameters were selected to investigate the effect of temperature on the tribological properties of EHEA based on the study of Du [24] and Deng [26] on the tribological properties of EHEA by load and velocity.

        "input": "2, it is intuitively clear that the grey-white phase is Mo-rich for the laves phase and the grey-black phase is Mo-poor for the FCC phase. The reason is that the larger atomic radius difference between Mo and Si elements and the extremely negative mixing enthalpy of Si elements with other elements make it more likely to form the intermetallic compound phase between Mo and Si elements, while the atomic radius difference and the mixing enthalpy of Fe, Co, Cr and Ni elements close to zero make it easier to form the FCC phase, which is consistent with the design of eutectic high entropy alloys containing non-metallic elements by Lu et al. [30]. In addition, the interface between the coating and the substrate (Fig. 3(c)) is clear, indicating that a strong metallurgical bonding interface was obtained between the coating and the substrate, and the coating interface shows a rough columnar crystal structure accompanied by a hypoeutectic structure dominated by a grey-black phase (FCC) and supplemented by grey-white streaks (Laves). The possible reasons for the formation of a hypoeutectic structure rather than a eutectic structure in the interface region are as follows: (1) During the laser cladding process, the heat of the molten pool is rapidly dissipated through the substrate along the direction perpendicular to the interface, and at the same time, in the interface region between the coating and the substrate, the molten pool is in direct contact with the substrate, which generates a large temperature gradient.

The previous study indicates that this nanosheet laminar structure possesses high strength and toughness [18,33]. As a result, it can mitigate stress concentration during the friction process. The corresponding maps for selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 4(c)-Fig. 4(d)) show that the eutectic biphasic phase consists of an FCC phase along the [011] zone axis and a Laves phase along the [1213] zone axis. Additionally, the corresponding EDS spectra reveal that the dark grey phase consists of the FCC phase with Fe, Co, Cr, and Ni as the main component and the Mo-rich bright grey phase corresponds to the Laves phase. To study the correlation between the two phases in eutectic struc\u00ad ture, we analyzed the interface between the FCC and Lave phases, as shown in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 5(a)). The interfacial smoothness at the nanoscale between the two phases is manifested as a distribution of discrete atomic steps along the phase interface due to the lower or higher solid solution entropy in the solidification process, which is the typical morphology of the non-faceted eutectic growth [33\u201335].

This is in agreement with the lattice constants that have been determined by XRD. In addition, we have identified a specific orientation relationship, i.e. [011]FCC // [1213]Laves. Besides, the angle of orientation mismatch between the close-packed planes of the FCC phase and the Laves phase is approximately 22.95\u25e6. As a result, the parameter of mismatch between the two phases is calculated via the formula \u03c3 = 0.238nm-0.204nm/cos(22.95\u25e6) 0.204nm/cos(22.95\u25e6) ~0.0743 [33], suggesting a semi-coherent interface between the two phases. A cluster of dislocations caused by lattice mismatch can be observed at the interface between the FCC and Laves phases. This is demonstrated in the FFT filtered image (Fig. 5 (g)). 3.2. Phase formation Thermophysical parameters such as \u0394Smix (entropy of mixing), \u0394 Hmix (enthalpy of mixing), VEC (valence electron concentration), and \u03b4 (atomic size difference) are considered to be a predictor of the crystal structure of HEAs, and the relationship between the phase and the thermophysical parameters has been explored by many researchers.

Moreover, EHEAs with FCC+TCP phases tend to form when the VEC is between 7.5 and 8.5, and EHEAs with BCC+TCP phases tend to form when the VEC is between 6 and 7.5, as illustrated by the two dashed ellipses in Fig. 7(b). Hence, it is apparent from Fig. 7 that the FeCoCrNi2MoSi EHEA fits both empirical criteria and tends to form a eutectic structure with the FCC/Laves phase, a tendency which is also consistent with the current experimental results. 3.3.

The find\u00ad ings suggest that the Laves phase displays increased hardness and resistance to deformation, whereas the FCC phase exhibits greater sus\u00ad ceptibility to plastic deformation. Furthermore, synergistic effects dur\u00ad ing friction may be induced by the alternative structures with both soft and hard heterogeneity in two phases.

Tribology International 194 (2024) 109534 9 800 \u2103) were also systematically investigated. The main conclusions of this study are as follows. (1) The FeCoCrNi2MoSi EHEA coating displays a typical eutectic lamellar structure, with a lamellar size of approximately 150 nm, consisting of alternating Laves and FCC phases. Nanoindentation tests reveal that the Laves phase is rigid and fragile, the FCC phase, on the other hand, has a low yield strength but excellent deformation capacity. (2) FeCoCrNi2MoSi EHEA exhibits excellent wear resistance at different temperatures. The dry sliding wear behaviors at RT and elevated temperatures show that the wear resistance of EHEA is enhanced with increasing temperature.

Notably, the surface of hea layer without soaking treatment exhibits more \u201ccellular growth\u201d metal particles, resulting in a lower n value. However, after soaking treatment, there is a significant increase in the n value, suggesting the formation of a uniform and dense oxide film on the surface of cocrfenial high entropy alloy layer which effectively enhances its corrosion resistance. 4.

The results induce solid solution strengthening and precipitate strengthening to improve the mechanical properties. The W alloying and annealing temperature of Co30Cr30(FeNi)40\u2212xWx HEAs have a significant impact on the formation and stability of \u03bc phase. HEAs tend to form microstructures with thermo- dynamic stability by minimizing Gibbs free energy change (\u0394Gmix) at a certain driving force [28,29]. To Xue-feng GAO, et al/Trans. Nonferrous Met.

Combined with XRD results, it can be inferred that Al1.25 alloy is composed of FCC phase rich in Co-Cr-Fe-Ni and BCC phase rich in Ni\u2013Al. In order to explore the phase structure of Al1.25 alloy with a fine lamellar eutectic structure and further explain the phase transition, a DSC test was carried out (as shown in Fig. 3). There is only one sharp peak in the curve, proving that there is only one phase transformation process during the heating process. The results are consistent with the characteristics of eutectic reaction, which proves that Al1.25 alloy is EHEA. 3.2. Mechanical Properties Engineering stress-strain curve of AlxCoCrFeNi3 HEAs is shown in Fig. 4(a). The curves of tensile strength, yield strength and fracture strain with the increase of Al content are shown in Fig. 4(b-d). The tensile strength and yield strength of AlxCoCrFeNi3 HEAs increase first and then decrease with the increase in Al. The strength of Al1.25 alloy is the highest, which may be related to the fine eutectic lamellar structure. The fine eutectic structure increases the proportion of phase boundaries and increases the contribution of interfacial strengthening. The fracture strain gradually decreases with the increase of Al (as shown in Fig. 4(d)), which attributes to the increase of the content of the hard and brittle",

Al1.25 alloy has the highest yield strength (535.32 MPa) and tensile strength (1060.59 MPa) and a relatively high fracture strain (17.21%), achieving an excellent balance of strength and plasticity. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the yield strength and fracture strain of Al1.25 alloy with other AlCoCrFeNi eutectic and near-eutectic HEAs, showing that Al1.25 alloy achieves an excellent balance of strength and plasticity [18,19,22,27,29\u201346]. AlCoCrFeNi HEAs in this work and the previous work are composed of FCC and BCC phases, but the difference in relative content seriously affects the balance of strength and plas\u00ad ticity. Excessive FCC increases the plasticity but decreases the strength, and conversely, increases the strength but decreases the plasticity.

The fracture of Al1 alloy is mainly dimple morphology, which is due to the high proportion of soft FCC phase, resulting in excellent plasticity. With the increase of Al content, the proportion of eutectic lamellar structure increases, and the fracture morphology of the lamellar shape is formed.

Strengthening Mechanism In this work, Al1.25 alloy achieves a balance between strength and plasticity. This excellent strength and plasticity are mainly attributed to the fine eutectic lamellar structure. The alternating soft FCC and hard BCC eutectic structure can not only maintain the plasticity but also improve the strength. The main strengthening mechanism is the phase interfacial strengthening mechanism. In addition, grain boundary strengthening, solid solution strengthening and friction stress strength\u00ad ening are also important strengthening mechanisms. These strength\u00ad ening mechanisms mainly hinder the movement of dislocations by increasing lattice distortion, generating phase interfaces and generating hard second phases, thereby jointly improving the strength of the",

Here, the estimated \u03c4K is 0.61 GPa. In summary, the overall interfacial barrier strength (\u03c4int) is 7.75 GPa. According to dislocation pile-up theory, the heterogeneous interfacial strengthening (\u0394\u03c3int) is related to the strength of the interfacial barrier strength (\u03c4int), given as [50], \u0394\u03c3int = [ Gb\u03c4int \u03c0(1 \u2212\u03c5) ] 1 2 \u2022 L\u22121 2 (4) where, L is the pile-up length (estimated as the thickness of lamellar FCC phase, 1 \u03bcm)\u3002Therefore, the contribution of interfacial strengthening to yield strength is calculated to be 209.4 MPa.

In order to facilitate the comparison between the calcu\u00ad lated data and the experimental data and to clearly compare the contribution values of various strengthening mechanisms, a histogram is drawn, as shown in Fig. 9. Obviously, the calculated data are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the phase interface strengthening contributes the most to the improvement of strength. The errors in the calculation results are mainly due to the calculation model and the parameter references to conventional alloys. Nevertheless, the agreement between the calculated and experimental data is very satisfactory. 4.2. Deformation Behavior In order to better understand the micromechanical behavior of het\u00ad erogeneous dual-phase eutectic Al1.25 alloy and establish the relation\u00ad ship between mechanical properties and microstructure, the microscopic deformation behavior and crack initiation mechanism during the tensile process are further discussed. The heterogeneous eutectic Al1.25 alloy has a soft and hard alter\u00ad nating BCC/FCC lamellar structure (as shown in Figs. 2 and 7). During tensile deformation, the soft FCC phase is more prone to plastic defor\u00ad mation. However, FCC phase is rigidly constrained by the hard BCC lamellar phase and cannot undergo significant plastic deformation.

The strengthening mechanism and deformation behavior of Al1.25CoCrFeNi3 alloy are emphatically analyzed, and the relationship between microstructure evolution and micromechanical behavior is established. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) With the increase of Al, AlxCoCrFeNi3 HEAs gradually change from hypoeutectic structure to hypereutectic structure. Al1.25CoCrFeNi3 alloy exhibits a fine FCC/BCC eutectic lamellar structure. (2) The yield strength of AlxCoCrFeNi3 HEAs increases first and then decreases with the increase of Al, and the plasticity keeps decreasing. Al1.25CoCrFeNi3 HEA has the highest yield strength, tensile strength and good plasticity, which are 535.32 MPa, 1060.59 MPa and 17.21%, respectively, showing a good balance of strength and plasticity.

The region located point C, was enriched with elements Fe, Co, Ni and Si, and formed fewer oxidation products. Si elements could improve the elevated temperature oxidation resistance of high entropy alloys by acting as an activator of Cr, increasing the activity of Cr in the alloy and making it easier to form protective oxide Cr2O3 [40]. Dense Cr2O3 and SiO2 oxide layer hindered the reaction of deeper layers of the coating with oxygen elements and reduced the oxide production rate. When the elevated temperature oxidation time increased to 200 h, there was no stripping due to the formation of a dense oxide film on the surface of the coating. Compared to elevated temperature oxidation for 100 h, the area with more oxidation products had become a region rich in Fe, Co, Ni and Si elements, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3. The volatilization of MoO3 at elevated temperature resulted to the reducing of oxidation products on the area rich in Mo and B elements. For the Fig. 2.

It was obvious that the coating had a lower oxidation rate, indicating that the coating had more excellent antioxi\u00ad dant properties [42]. 3.2. Room temperature tribological performance 3.2.1. Coefficient of friction The coefficient of friction(COF) curves and the average COF of the specimens before and after elevated temperature oxidation at room temperature are shown in Fig. 15. In the primary stage, the COF rose sharply due to severe plastic deformation caused by the extrusion of abrasive balls into the coating surface. The COF of the specimens surface existed a certain difference in the early stage of wear due to the oxide film formed after elevated temperature oxidation which could be used as a lubricant to resist a certain amount of wear [43]. As the wear test progressed, the COF stabilized due to the periodic accumulation and elimination of wear debris. Compared with 42CrMo steel, the COF of the coating (about 0.47) before and after elevated temperature oxidation was smaller due to the higher microhardness and more stable in the later stages of wear, which met the COF requirements (about 0.4) of brake discs for high-speed trains. The average COF of 42CrMo steel after elevated temperature oxidation decreased from 0.61 to 0.57 due to the increase in micro\u00ad hardness after elevated temperature oxidation. The average COF of the coating before and after elevated temperature oxidation was not significantly discrepancy due",

By altering the sputtering power (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 W) of the Y target, the elemental content of the films was changed. 2.2. Film characterization The phases of the films were analyzed by Cu-K\u03b1 X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV) at 40 kV and 40 mA.

The thickness, chemical composition, and microstructure of the films were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE- SEM) fitted with an energy dispersive spectrometer detector (EDS). The specimen preparation for TEM analysis was prepared using focused ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM, Helios NanoLab 650, FEI, USA). The structure of the films was evaluated by high-resolution transmission electron mi\u00ad croscopy (HRTEM, Talos F200X) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

Deposition rate and chemical composition of films The deposition rate and chemical composition of as-deposited (MoTaWNb)1-xYx films are shown in Fig. 1. With the Y-target power enhancement, the thickness of the deposited film increases gradually as well. The deposition rate of the film is closely correlated with power, maintaining a stable linear growth trend from 0 to 60 W before abruptly increasing to 21.67 nm/min at 80 W. This is primarily because an in\u00ad crease in sputtering power results in a marked improvement in the rate of argon ionization and an increase in ion energy. This increases the deposition rate at which target atoms are bombarded and the number of deposited atoms that reach the substrate in a given amount of time [21]. The sputtering yield of the Y element is discovered to be much bigger than that of the Ta and W elements under Ar ion bombardment at en\u00ad ergies <1000 eV, and a surge interval appears for the sputtering yield of the Y target with rising power [22]. Trace levels of elemental O were discovered in the films, which can be attributed to the",

Research on constit\u00ad uent phases in HEAs systems has revealed that three parameters pri\u00ad marily predict the phase selection of amorphous, solid solution, and intermetallic phases: atomic size difference (\u03b4), mixing enthalpy (\u0394Hmix), and mixing entropy (\u0394Smix), which are defined as: \u03b4 = 100 \u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305 \u2211 n i=1 ci(1 \u2212ri/r)2 \u221a (1) \u0394Hmix = \u2211 n i=1,i\u2215 =j \u03a9ijcicj (2) \u0394Smix = \u2212R \u2211 n i=1 cilnci (3) where r = \u2211n i=1 ciri, ci and ri are the atomic percentage and atomic radius of the ith element.

The thermodynamic parameter values of (MoTaWNb)1-xYx RHEA films are shown in Fig. 3. The findings demonstrate a significant reliance of the film\u2019s thermodynamic characteristics on its Y concentration. The deposited films exhibit a growing elemental Y content, with \u0394Hmix and \u0394Smix appearing to increase and thereafter drop, whereas \u03b4 displays an increasing trend. Large atomic size differences cause significant strain energy increases and lattice distortions. This allows deposited atoms to diffuse slowly, slowing down grain growth and forming amorphous and nanocrystalline formations. Simultaneously, Gibbs free energy can be greatly reduced by a high \u0394Smix and a lower negative \u0394Hmix. This lessens the inclination to form ordered phases and intermetallic compounds, which promotes the formation of amorphous phases in alloys [26].

The friction heat and contact stress will encourage the sintering and adhesion of the debris particles, causing some oxide layers to adhere to the wear surface and form an adhesion layer. Most of the oxide layer on the film is severely cracked and is very easy to peel off from the wear surface, seriously reducing its wear resistance. At the same time, trace Si elements were found in the adhesion layer, indi\u00ad cating that there was slight adhesive wear between the film and the friction pair. Part of the V-shaped columnar microstructures in the Y- added RHEA films are preserved and cause slight plastic deformation. Most of the V-shaped columnar fractures quickly in response to contact stress, generating wear debris up until it is flush with the wear surface (Fig. 13a1). Bhowmick et al.

This deformation mechanism can distribute part of the applied load to the matrix of the peripheral and central slip zones of the column, which effectively improves the wear resistance of the films. In addition, under the action of cyclic shear stress, the nanoscale pores in the films will concentrate stress, providing conditions for the propagation of cracks, which will eventually lead to the fracture of the structure and delamination on the surface of the Y-added RHEA films. The above ev\u00ad idence shows that the wear mechanism of the Y-added RHEA films is mainly abrasive, oxidation, and delamination wear. 4. Conclusions This work reports the effective preparation of (MoTaWNb)1-xYx RHEA films by MS and a detailed investigation of the influence of Y additions on their microstructure and mechanical properties. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: (1) The (MoTaWNb)1-xYx RHEA films exhibit a mixed microstructure of BCC and amorphous phases.

Alloys containing W each have what was earlier postulated [38] to be a nanoglass (NG) structure, elongated in the growth direction of the deposits. NiFeCoMo has a unique structure of laminated layers of amorphous and nanocrystalline (8 nm grain size) phases in roughly equal area fractions. A notable part of the microstructure that may affect the properties of these electrodeposited HEAs is banding, which typically resulted from segregation of Ni with W and Fe with Mo (see Fig. 1). In the instance of NiFeCoMo, such segregation was severe enough to result in a coupled structural banding effect, with Ni-rich regions taking on a nanocrystal\u00ad line structure, and Mo-rich regions an amorphous structure (Fig. 1b). Band thickness measurements performed on cross-sectional SEM and TEM micrographs are summarized in Table 2. Overall, measurements from SEM micrographs resulting in greater band thickness, as the contrast was primarily dominated by topographical differences between the bands, resulting from selective etching of layers of varying compo\u00ad sition when exposed to colloidal silica polishing medium (20 nm particle size). Band thickness measured by TEM was much smaller, on the order of tens",

NiFeCoW (Fig. 2a) had a stable amorphous structure below 500 \u25e6C, at which point nanograin nucleation commenced, forming a mixed crystalline-amorphous structure. The rightward shift of the emerging crystalline peak as compared to the amorphous profile points to a BCC \u03b1-Fe structure, following what has been previously observed in annealed amorphous FeW electrodeposits [47]. This evolution to a nanocrystalline structure continued up to 600 \u25e6C with more pronounced crystalline phase formation in the form of an FCC \u03b3-Ni and W-rich BCC phase. At 700 \u25e6C, significant phase decomposition developed in the form of both metallic and intermetallic compounds relating to impurities and surface oxidation. Although the sample surfaces were ion-milled to remove the thin layer of oxidized material (~200 nm thick), cracks that formed in the deposits as a result of annealing allowed oxidation to",

The peak temperature for grain growth in these electrodeposited ma\u00ad terials generally increased with their number of elements, making the largest jump of ~100 \u25e6C from 3-element (NiFeCo) to 4-elements (NiFeCoMo). The NiFeCoMoW, however, saw no improvement over NiFeCoMo, likely owing to limitations in its total Mo+W content (a result of restrictions in its synthesis, as discussed in further detail in ref. [38]). The activation energies for grain growth describe a clearer conclusion: Incremental increases were observed with each added element from pure metal to binary, ternary, and quaternary, reaching a maximum of 3.1 eV in NiFeCoW. The lower Q in NiFeCoMo compared to NiFeCoW is likely a result of its laminated structure. With the crystalline layers being depleted of Mo, the activation energy for their growth would likely be lower than that for the amorphous layers. The activation energy being of similar value to NiFe and NiFeCo (MEAs) is evidence of this. NiFeCoMoW having a slightly lower Q (2.9 eV) compared to NiFeCoW (3.1 eV) may be a result of limitations in achieving a perfectly equimolar alloy, with the total composition of Mo+W limited to ~25 at. %, as outlined in ref. [38]. Table 4 summarizes the activation energies for lattice self-diffusion (Qv) and grain boundary diffusion (Qgb) for diffusion couples made up of Ni, Fe, Co, Mo, and W.

The activation energy for grain growth of equimolar NiFeCo is consistent with that of lattice self-diffusion for Ni, Fe, and Co, whereas in the pure metals (Ni and Co) it is comparatively low, on an order consistent with that of grain boundary self-diffusion of their respective elements. Considering the pure W and Mo diffusion couples, it would at first appear that the addition of one or both of these elements to the NiFeCo base forces a reversion back to grain-boundary diffusion, as the Qv is far higher (4\u20136.6 eV) than the measure of acti\u00ad vation volumes for grain growth in NiFeCo-(Mo/W) (2.3\u20133.1 eV). However, in considering binary couples with more dilute concentrations of Mo and W (which is more representative of the case of these elec\u00ad trodeposits), the measured data instead falls closer in line with the activation energies for self-diffusion, as observed in NiFeCo. 3.4. Strengthening mechanisms The hardness (or strength) of a given material can be represented as the sum of contributions from the hardening mechanisms that it ex\u00ad hibits. One of the simplest formulations of this is: H = Ho + HSS + HGB + Hstrain + Hprecip (8) where Ho is the friction stress contribution, HSS solid-solution (SS) hardening, HGB grain-boundary hardening, Hsrain strain hardening, and Hprecip precipitation hardening.

Whereas in bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) the extent of local order varies randomly throughout the material, the excess volume contained within the interphase regions of nanoglasses (NGs) are approximately structurally comparable to shear bands [71,72]. In this way, NGs can undergo more homogenous deformation compared to BMGs owing to the activation of STZs along predefined boundaries [73]. This is expected to translate to a lower activation volume for NGs than BMGs or fully amorphous alloys, as activation of STZs would be more dependent on local structural defects in these materials.

However, the YS dramatically decreases due to the reduction of dislocations. As shown in Fig. 8, the grains are growing into large grains, and as the grain\u2019s size increases, dislocations are significantly decreased, and finally, the YS is reduced. It is well known that high-temperature sintering causes struc\u00ad tural ductility. The as-sprayed and sintered samples remain a single fcc structure (Fig. 4), and the ductility is mainly caused by grain growth. The measured value of hardness (Table 1) was used to represent the yield strength of as-sprayed and sintered sample deposits as a function of grain size using the classical Hall\u2013Petch relationship [72]: H = H0 + khpd\u22121 / 2 (12) where H0 is the intrinsic hardness of the deposit, d is the average grain size, and khp is the Hall\u2013 Petch coefficient.

The bright-field (BF) TEM image in Fig. 11c exhibits remarkable dislocation trapping and retention mechanism at the cellular substructure boundaries, leading to the increase of dislocation density inside the cellular grains. Large area of planar slip bands, microbands and mechanical twins can be found (Fig. 11d\u2013f), and these deformation substructures can substantially interact with cellular substructure to form a three-dimensional dislocation network. In short, the pinning of dislocations at the cellular substructure interface will produce a signif\u00ad icant work hardening effect, thus improving the strength of the SLMed FeCoCrNiMo0.2 HEA, while the highly activated multiple deformation behavior is conducive to alleviating stress concentration and making additional contributions to the high plasticity. 4.

Thus, the strength strength\u00ad ening contribution from compositional segregation in the SLMed FeCoCrNiMo0.2 HEA under energy density of 47 J/mm3, 78 J/mm3 and 150 J/mm3 are estimated to be 299.9 MPa, 311.6 MPa, 320.7 MPa, respectively. Through the above analysis, the strength contribution of the SLMed FeCoCrNiMo0.2 HEA at different energy densities is summa\u00ad rized in Fig. 13, exhibiting a good agreement between the calculated results and the experimental data. It indicates that the segregation strengthening and dislocation strengthening stand out as the primary contributors to the SLMed FeCoCrNiMo0.2 HEA. In addition, the cellular substructure can act as a micro-heterogeneity consisting of hard cellular substructure boundaries and soft cellular substructure matrix [3,48], producing a high hetero-deformation induced (HDI) hardening. The Mo segregation along the cellular substructure boundaries is believed to promote both boundary dislocation density and strength [15,49,50], which is conducive to further enhancing the HDI stresses. This means that the cellular substructure size and the degree of Mo segregation at the boundaries directly impact the above strengthening mechanisms. Thus, controlling the microstructure of cellular substructures is an effective way to optimize the mechanical properties of SLM alloys. 5.

Fig. 7j-k shows the typical microstructure of the mixed grain zone along the building direction where fine grains coexist with large grains. It can be seen from the figure that the grain is equiaxed and has no obvious texture. The microstructure development of molten pool is determined by solidification behavior [34]. In general, the additive manufacturing process experiences a fast melting and fast solidification process. During solidification, the grain growth direction tends to be perpendicular to the solid-liquid interface. At this time, the temperature gradient in this direction is the largest, and the driving force generated is also the largest [35]. In the process of SLM preparation of high-entropy alloy additive specimen, high energy laser irradiation and rapid cooling in a very short time will lead to the formation of fine grains, while the large tempera\u00ad ture gradient and heat flow direction will promote the further formation of columnar crystals.

It is not difficult to find that the three data (elongation (\u03b5), yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in this work are all higher than those in previous studies [46\u201348]. The selected studies all contain refractory elements. This work is also compared by different processes with the same composition. It is also proved that the uniformity of refractory elements has a great influence on the mechanical properties of HEAs. For alloys containing refractory elements, the spherical powders obtained by common processes (PREP, GA) have the problem of uneven composition. There is component segregation in the molded parts prepared by additive manufacturing, resulting in uneven local distribution of stress in the molded parts during high temperature service. And it is easy to appear local deformation and cause cracking. It restricts the large-scale application of additive manufacturing metals in the field of preparing high-temperature resistant materials. Fig. 13a and d show the micromorphologies of spherical powders prepared by different processes (a: PHTR-SLM; b: GA-SLM). It is clear that GA-SLM has cracks (Fig. 13d, yellow circle). Intrachrystalline segregation can result in uneven grain composition and eventually different grain types: for PHTR, additive manufacturing results in equiaxed crystals (Fig. 13b). For GA-SLM, component segregation re\u00ad sults in a mixture of equiaxed and columnar crystals (Fig. 13e). This ultimately leads to a decrease in the mechanical properties of the alloy, especially the ductility and toughness [49].

In addition, there is a large temperature gradient when the alloy melts and solidifies, and cracks, spheroidization and other defects occur during the layer by layer forming process, which seriously affects the microstructure and properties of the additive specimen. 5. Conclusion In this paper, spherical high entropy alloy powders were prepared by a new technology, aiming at composition uniformity. Thus, The high entropy alloy spherical powders (Ni8Cr4Co4Fe6W2) prepared by the method were used to print the forming parts by additive manufacturing. The evaluation includes the preparation of 3D forming parts with the same chemical composition by conventional GA processes as a refer\u00ad ence. The ability to produce refractory HEAs through PHTR method will make it possible to manufacture complex geometry shapes in high temperature service environment (such as aviation engine blades) with bright application potential at a reasonable cost. The conclusions were made as follows: \u2022 The HEA powder obtained by PHTR method can homogenize the internal composition.

It can be seen from Fig. 4(a\u2013c) that BPNN shows excellent prediction accuracy when training the data of CG, NFG/NG, and HSMs indiscriminately (Most of the schemes in Tables 1 and 2 have lower MAPE values relative to linear theory). However, for the performance of the BP network, there is an optimal combination of the number of hidden layers and the activation function, which makes the prediction accuracy the highest and the number of training steps minimum. In the structure with 4 layers of neurons (input layer, hidden layer M \u2212N, and output layer), when the activation function of the hidden layer M \u2212N is F2-2, the prediction accuracy is the highest and the number of training steps is the lower, the MAPE is 5.36%, and the number of training steps is 14 (Fig. 4(b)). After continuing to add the hidden layer F, the prediction accuracy drops significantly, and the change of the activation function will cause a large fluctuation in the prediction accuracy, making it easier",

When using the L-RR to describe the CG dataset (Eq. (15)), the MAPE value is 3.46% (Fig. 5(a and b)), and the R2 score is 0.98. Since the grain surface area of NG/UFG is larger relative to the volume, the scale co\u00ad efficient of surface atoms is higher, and the corresponding interface defects and grain boundary defects will also increase. As a result, when the linear strengthening rule fits the NG/UFG dataset (Fig. 5(c)), it can cover about 90% of the data, and the MAPE value increases to 13.42%. HSMs often contain different phases, and they can vary in size, shape, composition, and arrangement. The interactions generated by the spatial heterogeneity of these different structures have a great influence on the behavior of materials such as lattice defects, grain boundaries, disloca\u00ad tions, and interphase shearing. These complex interactions make the mechanical behavior of HSMs difficult to describe by traditional linear strengthening methods (Fig. 5(d)), leading to a significant increase in the MAPE value to 16.23% and a decrease in the R2 score to 0.81.

It can be deduced from the articles reviewed that the inclusion of HEAps as re\u00ad inforcements in MMCs improves the overall mechanical properties including ductility and toughness of the matrix most especially when the amount of HEAps added is not more than 10 vol%. It can be concluded from the works reviewed so far that the interaction at the interface be\u00ad tween HEAps and the metal matrix leads to the formation of a diffusion layer, which may either enhance or degrade the interfacial bonding between the matrix and the HEAps. For some of the studies examined, the interfacial diffusion layer in HEAp-MMCs enhanced the composites\u2019 mechanical properties, resulting in their effective load transfer and improved ductility. Different inter\u00ad face products, a function of the composites\u2019 composition, are formed at the diffusion layer between the HEAps and the matrix structure. How\u00ad ever, because some of the diffusion interface layer could also degrade the performance of the composites, the mechanism driving the forma\u00ad tion of these diffusion interfacial layers should be extensively investi\u00ad gated to gain an understanding on how they can be controlled or manipulated to improve the performance of HEAp-MMCs.

Therefore, further research is needed to determine the extent to which the mechanical properties, including ductility and toughness, are enhanced in MMC/HEAp composites compared to conventional ceramic-reinforced MMCs. 3.2. Wear resistance Wear frequently occurs whenever there is any kind of relative motion in any part, such as reciprocating and rotational piston movements, cylinder bores, brake rotors, connecting rods and so on. When manufacturing these kinds of components, wear is an essential factor to consider to guarantee better and more constant performance in any tribological application. The conventional MMCs showed greater wear resistance than their monolithic alloys. However, their poor fracture toughness and low ductility hindered their employment in service ap\u00ad plications. HEAs display exceptional physical qualities, such as excep\u00ad tional strength metrics and hardness, excellent thermal stability, and high levels of wear resistance. As a result, HEAs are potentially very promising materials for enhancing the wear resistance of the metal matrix. We discuss the wear behaviour of HEAp-reinforced metal matrix composites in the succeeding sub-sections. 3.2.1. Aluminium matrix AMCs exhibit better wear resistance than typical Al alloys, enabling them to withstand difficult braking challenges.
