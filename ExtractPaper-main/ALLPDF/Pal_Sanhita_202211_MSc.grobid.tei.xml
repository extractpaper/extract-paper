<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of advanced metallic materials that have received significant attention in recent years due to their stable microstructures and promising properties.</p><p>They are characterized by their peculiar mixing of five or more principal elements in equimolar concentrations. It has been argued that HEAs exhibit high configurational entropy features that arise from compositionally complex mixing, which enable them to stabilize a single-phase solid solution structure. Owing to the solid solution phase formations, these alloys have shown immense structural properties, including excellent strength and fracture toughness, which make them potential candidates for extreme environmental conditions. Surface modification allows the possibility of combining bulk properties of the substrate with the tailored capabilities of coatings, thereby creating a new range of possibilities. Smart functional coatings incorporating new functionalities and coherent responses have surpassed the traditional capabilities of coatings and have taken surface technologies to new heights. Presently, the potential benefits of HEAs are being extended to development of coatings via thermal spraying. The exploration of high entropy alloys in conjunction with thermal spraying techniques to address numerous challenges in extreme engineering environments is still in their early stage of development. Only a few studies were attempted to develop thermal-sprayed HEA coatings to protect against wear and corrosion. However, limited, if any, studies on functional properties such as thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties of thermal sprayed HEA coatings have been pursued.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>iii Solid particle erosion is a typical wear mode that negatively impacts the longevity of parts in many sectors like aerospace, marine, mining, wind energy, and oil and gas; thus improving the erosion resistance of the components in this sector is economically important. The second aspect of this work revolves around studying the solid particle erosion properties of these coatings.</p><p>The goal of this study was to develop novel AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA compositions to understand how tungsten (W) and vanadium (V) additions in AlCoCrFeMo influence the evolution of microstructures, phase formations, microhardness, electrical resistivity and solid particle erosion properties.</p><p>A cost-effective flame spray technique was utilized to produce three different equiatomic AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW, and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings on stainless steel substrates.</p><p>To avoid conductivity and short-circuiting during Joule heating experiments, an insulating layer of alumina was deposited on to the substrates before coating depositions. The coatings were characterized using XRD and SEM. The Vickers microhardness technique was used to quantify hardness. A custom assembly was used to determine the electrical resistivity and analyze the Joule heating performance of the coatings. The Joule heating performance was compared on the basis of the rate of increase in surface temperature for a given power input. Solid particle erosion studies were performed using a modified version of the ASTM G-76 standard with a low-pressure cold spray unit, using garnet sand as the erodent and the surface morphology was studied.</p><p>The microstructure of the HEA coatings showed the presence of multiple oxide regions along with solid-solution phases. The HEA coatings had an average thickness of approximately <ref type="bibr">153 ± 14 μm</ref> with porosity between 2 to 3%. High hardness values were recorded for all coatings with AlCoCrFeMoV showing the highest hardness. The electrical resistivity values were higher for all the HEA coatings compared to flame-sprayed Ni-20Cr and NiCrAlY coatings and AlCoCrFeNi HEA thin film, which may be attributed to the characteristics of HEAs, such as severe lattice distortion and solute segregations. The coatings have shown improved Joule heating performance when compared with conventional Ni-20Cr flame-sprayed coatings, as indicated by the higher rate of increase in surface temperature for a given power input. Solid particle erosion studies indicated that the coatings underwent a brittle mode of failure. The erosion rate of all three coatings was found to be independent of temperature on testing up to 250 °C. It was statistically determined that AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW coatings have better solid particle erosion resistance than the AlCoCrFeMoV coatings. The erosion rate of the coatings was found to be linearly dependent on the H⁄E (elastic strain to break) ratio and decreased with increasing value of H⁄E ratio. The combined interaction of high hardness, increased electrical resistivity and improved erosion resistance properties suggests that the flame-sprayed HEA coatings can be used as multi-functional wear-resistant materials for energy generation applications. In the end, I am incredibly grateful to my parents Goutam and Mithu for letting me pursue my dreams, being present for me whenever I needed them, tolerating me and living with my absence from their life. I am obliged to Harshal for bringing joy and statistics to my life and being a constant support. I am so thankful to all my friends for being patient, listening to my cribbing and encouraging me whenever I was low. Lastly, I thank the universe for bringing my kitties-the love of my life, Mota and Luna to my life who made me immensely patient and were always by my side whenever I was sad or lonely.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 1.</ref> Chemical composition of the HEA powders obtained from EDS in comparison to the nominal composition in atomic percentage………………………………………………………41  High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a novel class of materials which have received widespread attention recently because of their outstanding physical and mechanical properties.

The most unique aspect of HEAs is their ability to form simple solid solution structures irrespective of their complex mixture of elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background and Definition</head><p>For the past two decades, a unique concept of alloy designing by the mixing of multiple principal elements in high concentration has been in vogue. This unconventional form of alloy designing was first explored by the research group of Jien-Wei-Yeh in 2004 who was the first to coin the term high entropy alloy (HEA). According to the original definition proposed by Yeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>,</p><p>HEAs are those which are composed of five or more elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratio with the atomic concentration of each principal element being between 5% and 35%. Around the same time, another research group led by Brian Cantor unaware of the term coined by Yeh independently published their work on equiatomic FeCrMnNiCo referring to it as multicomponent alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Yeh and Cantor are regarded as the founding fathers of this new class of materials and their respective works on CuCoNiCrAlxFe and FeCrMnNiCo (also known as Cantor alloys) HEA compositions and their modifications have been widely studied by researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Four Core Effects-The reason for the unique properties of HEAs</head><p>The uniqueness of HEAs is attributed to the four core effects namely high configurational entropy, severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion and cocktail effect.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacturing of HEAs</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> shows the material hypertetrahedron summarizing the design-process-structure-property of HEAs. HEAs have been produced in a variety of forms like castings, sintered powder metallurgy parts, and films. The processing routes can be broadly classified into three groups, namely, the melting and casting route, powder metallurgy route, and deposition techniques. The processing routes are similar for equiatomic and non-equiatomic compositions. Melting and casting techniques, with equilibrium and nonequilibrium cooling rates, have been employed to produce HEAs in the shape of rods, bars, ribbons, and nanoparticles. The popular melt processing techniques include vacuum arc melting, vacuum induction melting, and melt spinning. Mechanical alloying followed by sintering has been the major solid-state processing route to produce sintered products. Sputtering, plasma nitriding, spraying and cladding are the surface modification techniques used to produce thin films and thick layers of HEAs on various substrates. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why are HEAs interesting?</head><p>With the multi-principal-element-based design approach, the compositional space of alloys can be considerably expanded. According to Cantor's conservative estimate, the total number of possible alloys that may be mapped out of 60 feasible elements is in the order of 10 100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Expectedly, the expansion of the compositional space alloys will undoubtedly bring about rich opportunities in achieving affluent, diverse microstructures as well as structural and functional properties unseen before. For example in contrast to conventional alloys which show a decrease in strength and ductility with increasing temperature the HEA studies on CrMnFeCoNi by Gludovatz et al.</p><p>showed an increase in strength and ductility with increasing temperature making them promising candidates for cryogenic applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Thus, the introduction of HEAs has opened the possibility of discovering new efficient alloys to fill targeted needs in niche applications.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, laser cladding <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> spraying <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>,</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HEA coatings their properties and application</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanical Behaviour -High Hardness and Elastic Modulus</head><p>Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> prepared the TiVCrAlSi HEA coating on the Ti-6Al-4V alloy surface by laser cladding, which had BCC phases and a microhardness close to 1000 HV0.2. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> prepared the Laser cladded 6FeNiCoSiCrAlTi HEA coating having a simple BCC solid solution with the microhardness of 780 HV0.5. FCC coatings CoCrFeNiAlxCu0.7Si0.1 having a high hardness of 502 HV0.5. have been prepared by He et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. DC Magnetron Sputtered single phase FCC coatings of FeAlCuCrCoMn having a hardness and Young's modulus of 17.5 and 186 Gpa respectively were studied by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Reactive-sputtered HEA nitride thin films pioneered by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> are being widely studied because of their super high hardness of over 40 Gpa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tribological Properties</head><p>The high hardness of the HEA coatings can help in the effective reduction of wear rate since the tribological properties are generally determined by mechanical properties. The excellent wear resistance of HEA coatings has been verified by numerous experiments. Some of them have been summarized below.</p><p>Lai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> studied the influence of the substrate bias voltage, on the microstructural and tribological properties of the (AlCrTaTiZr)N films prepared by reactive-magnetron sputtering. An almost constant low coefficient of friction of 0.75 and a low wear rate of 3.65×10 -6 mm 3 /Nm were achieved at the bias voltage of 150 V. Tian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> prepared the AlCoCrFeNiTi coating consisting of BCC matrix, minor FCC, and ordered BCC solid-solution phases by APS (Atmospheric Plasma Spray). Although the volumetric wear rate increased with an increase in temperature still it was better than laser-cladded NiCrBSi coating at the same temperature. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> synthesized the FeCoCrAlCu coating on the Q235 steel by laser surface alloying which had volume and specific wear rate values that were an order of magnitude lower than the substrate in dry-sliding conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corrosion resistance</head><p>Dou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> deposited DC magnetron sputtered FeAlCoCuNiV coatings having single phase FCC solid solution which exhibited better electrochemical corrosion resistance than the 201 stainless steels in acidic alkali and salt corrosion media. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> produced AlCoCrFeNi coatings on the AISI 1045 carbon steel by electrospark deposition. They found that the corrosion current of the HEA-coated specimen was significantly lower than those for the 1045 steel and the cast HEA material. It has been observed that the high-entropy effect added to the 'rapid quenching' effect arising due to the nature of the preparation processes of the HEA films and coatings facilitates the formation of a single FCC or BCC solid-solution phase or amorphous phase with the more homogeneous microstructure than their bulk counterparts, resulting in an improvement of the corrosion resistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-Temperature Stability</head><p>Superhard (AlCrNbSiTiV)N film made by Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> exhibited excellent thermal stability and retained a simple FCC structure after annealing at 1000°C for 5 h. Feng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> found that TaNbTiW alloy films revealed no phase changes even after being annealed at 500 and 700°C for 90 min in vacuum whereas, annealing at 900°C, resulted in the formation of only a few oxides peaks. The microhardness of as prepared laser-cladded coatings TiZrNbWMo reached up to 700 HV0.5, which remarkably increased after heat treatment and reached the maximum of about 1300HV0.5 at 800°C Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oxidation Resistance</head><p>The weight gains of thermal sprayed AlCrFeMo0.5NiSiTi and AlCoCrFeMo0.5NiSiTi HEA coatings prepared by Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>  and the weight gain after thermal ramping to 1300°C was merely 0.015 mg cm -2 . The oxidation resistance of these coatings was superior to other nitride coatings.</p><p>The high temperature and oxidation resistance of HEA coatings have been attributed to the high mixing entropy of the constituent elements, the lower diffusion coefficients and the re-distribution of solute elements during the annealing treatment, relative to the conventional films and coatings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical Properties</head><p>The review article by Tsai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> suggests a low-temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR)</p><p>and favourable soft magnetic properties in bulk HEA. However, only a limited number of literature highlighting the physical behaviour of HEAs exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. A few works exploring the magnetic and electrical properties have been indicated. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> fabricated BCC FeCoNiCrAlSi thin films with excellent soft magnetic properties. The optimized magnetic properties of thin films obtained had a Ms (saturation magnetization) of 9.13×105 A/m, hHc (coercivity at the hard axis) of 79.6</p><p>A/m, and Hk (out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy field) of 1.59×103 A/m, respectively. Qiu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> prepared the Al2CrFeNiCoCu HEA coating by laser cladding having small coercive force, for use as soft magnetic material. BiFeCoNiMn HEA films prepared by Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> using electrodeposition showed soft magnetic behaviour in an as-prepared state, while the annealed films exhibited hard magnetic properties. Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> deposited the amorphous BnbTa-TiZr thin films by magnetron sputtering, having a high electrical resistivity of 246 µΩ-cm. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> prepared the NiCrSiAlTa thin films by direct current magnetron co-sputtering which when annealed at 300°C exhibited high electrical resistivity of 2215 µΩ-cm with 10 ppm/°C of TCR.</p><p>Recently, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> have studied the resistivity -temperature behaviour of AlxCoCrFeNi (x=0.7-1.0) thin films and bulk HEA. The films comprised mixed FCC and BCC phases and exhibited ultra low-temperature coefficient of resistance in a range of ±10 ppm/K and the electrical resistivities ranged from 191.8 µΩ cm (for x=1.0) to 535.9 µΩ cm (for x = 0.7) which are way higher than those observed for conventional alloys. They have attributed these to severe lattice distortions, phonon scattering, and s-d scattering in transition metal alloys.</p><p>Thus, it can be said that HEA thin films have high electrical resistivity and potential application as resistors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffusion Retardation</head><p>A series of works by Chang et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> on HEA nitride films indicated its use as an effective diffusion barrier material. Severe lattice strain and a high packing density caused by different atom sizes, and high cohesive energy, were believed to be the dominant factors for suppressed interdiffusion kinetics through the multi-component barrier materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biocompatibility</head><p>Braic et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> deposited the (TiZrNbHfTa)N and (TiZrNbHfTa)C coatings on Ti-6Al-4V alloy by co-sputtering technique, with favourable outcomes. The investigated coatings did not induce any cytotoxic response by osteoblasts (24 and 72 h), and good morphology of the attached cells was observed. Cell viability analysis also showed a very high ratio of live cells compared with dead cells. Vladescu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> found in their research that the replacement of Ta by Si in the (TiZrNbTaHf)C coating led to an enhanced surface electrical, low electrical potential and high work function, exhibiting the best biocompatible properties out of the studied HEA.</p><p>The works cited before are an indication of the myriad application of HEA coatings and thin films.</p><p>Most of the work has focussed on the mechanical or tribological properties of HEA with little emphasis on the physical properties vis-à-vis electrical, magnetic or thermal. The limited literature on these aspects, however, indicates a wide range of possibilities. Moreover, little or no known attempts have been made to explore the multi-functional capabilities of HEA coatings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Thermal-sprayed HEA Coatings</head><p>Thermal spraying is a versatile, cost-effective and industrially established surface modification technology with extensive applications in the aerospace, turbines, oil and gas industries to name a few. It is a line-of-sight process, wherein feedstock material, in the form of powder, wire, rod, or suspension, is fed into a spray torch followed by heating up to a molten or near-molten state and propelled toward a base material <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.  The first TS HEA coatings using APS were reported by Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> who prepared the AlCrFeMo0.5NiSiTi and AlCoCrFeMo0.5NiSiTi coatings which showed significant hardening at high temperatures approximately around 925 HV after heat treatment for 1 hour <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> AlCoCrFeNiTi coating with an outstanding bond strength higher than 50.3±8.5Mpa and an average microhardness of the as-sprayed coating of 642 HV (approximately four times that of the 316 stainless steel -173 HV) were prepared by Tian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> using atmospheric plasma spray.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The use of HEAs as a potential alternative to traditional McrAlY bond coats has been studied by</head><p>Hsu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> who prepared AlSi0.2Ti0.2CrFe0.2Co0.6Ni0.2 HEA overlay coating using both APS and HVOF which had comparable hardness. However, the observed values of hardness 450 and 429 HV respectively for the APS and HVOF coatings are much higher than those observed for CoNiCrAlY-based coatings, which could imply better wear resistance for the HEA coatings. Lobel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> performed ball on disk and oscillating wear test on HVOF AlTiCrFeCoNi coatings which outperformed the hard chrome plated samples. HVOF Al30Si2Cr23Co22Ni23 coatings studied by Bhattacharya et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref> have demonstrated excellent oxidation resistance as required for aerospace applications. Vallimanalan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> have analyzed the corrosion behaviour of HVOFsprayed AlCrCoNiMo HEA coatings and compared it with a conventional NiCrSiB-based HVOF coating. Corrosion rate calculation using a Tafel plot demonstrated a lower corrosion rate (0.00276 mm/year) for the HEA coating compared to NiCrSiB coating (0.018 mm/year), thus concluding higher corrosion resistance for this particular HEA coating.</p><p>Nair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> compared the wear and corrosion properties of novel equimolar AlCoCrFeMo HEA alloy coatings made by flame spray and cold spray techniques. The microstructure and phases formed in the flame and cold sprayed coatings showed a significant difference. The flame sprayed coatings showed the presence of both oxides and BCC phases whereas the cold sprayed coatings had only BCC phases. The FS coatings showed a higher average hardness value of 5.78 ± 0.45</p><p>GPa as compared to the cold sprayed coatings which had an average hardness of 3.6 ± 0.45 GPa.</p><p>They had claimed that the presence of oxides in the flame spray coatings might be responsible for the higher hardness. The dry abrasive wear tests echoed the hardness trend. However, the cold spray coatings had a lower corrosion rate due to the low porosity and lack of oxides compared to the flame spray coatings. Their work is suggestive of the influence of microstructure on the mechanical properties of the coatings.</p><p>The review study by Meghwal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> on thermal spray HEA coatings indicates that HVOF TS coatings have the highest average hardness amongst all other TS processes. The reason for this high hardness has been attributed to super-saturated solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening and other mechanisms induced due to the processing technique. The present literature available on the wear properties of TS HEA suggests that the APS HEA coatings have better performance than HVOF and CS HEA. However, the commercial validity of TS HEA is yet to be validated due to the lack of high-temperature wear data. TS HEA coatings have not yet been extensively explored for their corrosive behaviour as compared to laser cladded coatings. Although the feasibility of producing HEA coatings by TS technology has been proven to be economically viable the present literature available suggests that the primary focus of TS HEA has been on the development of wear and oxidation-resistant coatings for high-temperature applications. Very few studies have explored the corrosion, fatigue, creep, fracture toughness and tensile properties of TS HEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>To the best knowledge of the candidate, there have been no studies exploring the physical properties of TS HEA coatings for functional application. Thus, the unique aspect of this research project lies in exploring the physical property of TS HEA coatings and their potential applicability as multi-functional coatings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Thermal Sprayed Coatings for Resistive Heating Applications</head><p>Electric resistance heating systems have been used successfully employed in power-line de-icing <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, cementitious composites for removal of snow from the surface of transportation infrastructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, carbon fibre resistance heating for mitigation of ice accumulation on road surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and anti-icing and de-icing of wind turbines <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> and pipelines to avoid freezing <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>. Mostly electrical heat tracers have been used for this purpose. Electric resistive heating systems based on the use of multi-layered thermally sprayed coatings have been proposed as an alternative to electrical heat tracers by Rezvani-Rad <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Thermal-sprayed coatings for different heating applications, substrate geometries and materials, and temperature ranges <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> have been investigated extensively. With the direct deposition of the films atop the test surface, as opposed to mechanically attaching the heater to the surface, the thermal contact resistance between the thermal-sprayed heating element and the substrate is minimized. This results in the fabrication of more efficient heating elements. The structure of the heating system depends on the electrical resistance of the metallic alloy that is required to be achieved, the substrate material and its electrical conductivity. Owing to the high thickness required to achieve the appropriate electrical resistance, thermal spraying techniques are preferred over vapour deposition for the fabrication of the coating-based heating elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. The application of thermal-sprayed coatings in electronics was first proposed almost five decades ago when planar ferrite microwave integrated circuits (MICs) were successfully fabricated by using the arc-plasma spraying (APS) process by Harris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The works of Smyth and Anderson <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> have suggested that APS can be used for cost-effective production of resistors and conductors with satisfactory long-term stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</p><p>The fabrication of meso-electronics by thermal spray techniques was studied by Sampath, et al.</p><p>[71], who reported that multilayer deposits of ceramics and metals having appropriate electrical properties can be produced by thermal spray methods to fabricate electrical components ranging from insulators, conductors, and resistors. They fabricated a NiCr resistor over alumina by plasma or HVOF processes having a sheet resistance in the range of 17-54 KΩ/sq. They concluded that the low cost, high production rate, capability of producing millimetre-thick layers of conductors and insulators and the flexibility of TS would make this process an alternative for the fabrication of components for power electronics. High-quality dielectrics and conductors have also been produced using cold spray techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p><p>Deposition of several different thermal-sprayed metal alloys, namely Molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), nickel-20 wt.% chromium (Ni-20Cr), nickel-5 wt.% aluminium (Ni-5Al), iron-13 wt.% chromium (Fe-13Cr), and Iron-chromium-aluminium (FeCrAl), by using various thermal spraying processes including APS, VPS, HVOF, wire arc, combustion spray, and wire flame spray, has been reported in the literature for usage as the heating elements <ref type="bibr">[63-65, 67, 72-74]</ref>.</p><p>Younis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref> fabricated a metal film resistance heater of molybdenum by APS that was able to generate heat fluxes up to 7.2 MW/m2 over an area of 10.3 cm 2 thus, showing that thermalsprayed coatings can be used as heating systems. Following this Michels et al. developed resistive heating Ni-20Cr coatings on dielectric alumina using VPS and HVOF which showed considerable improvement in performance with flux generated up to 17 MW/m 2 . However, the heaters failed at very high-level electrical currents due to the delamination of the Ni-Cr layer from the insulating ceramic layer because of high thermal stresses generated between the deposited ceramic and metallic films due to the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>.</p><p>Tong, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> investigated the fabrication of microheaters by combining thermal spray, as an additive manufacturing process, with micromachining, as a subtractive manufacturing process, to produce functional microheaters.

The thickness of the alumina and NiCr coatings were measured to be 200 and 30-50 μm, respectively. It was observed that NiCr coatings having a thickness greater than 50 μm tended to delaminate because of the high residual tensile stresses.</p><p>Prudenziati et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, developed self-regulated heaters for both planar and cylindrical geometries by air plasma spraying process that showed reliable performance up to 600 °C over long periods and can be used for application in the field of high-temperature operating sensors.</p><p>Lopera-Valle and McDonald <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> proposed the use of novel flame-sprayed coatings for the elimination of the formation of ice on wind turbine blades. They found out in their study that the flame spraying process could be used to deposit NiCr and NiCrAlY coatings on FRCP substrates without any damage to the substrate. A layer of garnet sand was used as an intermediary layer between the FRCP and metallic coating to prevent damage to the fibres of the composite during the high-temperature deposition process as well as increase the roughness of the substrate to promote adhesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Their subsequent work showed that the embedded coating-based de-icing system was able to melt the ice that was formed on top of the coated polymer-based composite when the specimens were exposed to forced convection conditions.</p><p>Milad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> fabricated multi-layered coating-based heating systems based on Ni-20Cr and Ni-50Cr on carbon steel pipes for de-icing and anti-icing purposes by various thermal spraying techniques, namely flame spraying, suspension plasma spraying, high-velocity oxy-fuel spraying and air plasma spraying. The development of a multi-layered coating system that consists of two main elements, namely the heating element which is usually a metallic alloy and an electrically insulating ceramic layer or dielectric like Al2O3 is required to prevent short-circuiting and leakage current in the heating system made of an electrically conductive substrate. They observed that only 20 watts was adequate to heat almost 600 cm 3 of ice from -20°C to 0°C and, more importantly, melt it when the pipe was directly exposed to the cold air at -25°C. They observed a notable relative difference in electrical resistivity of 68% in the case of flame-sprayed Ni-20Cr coatings fabricated using different spraying parameters. They thereby concluded that the microstructure of flame sprayed heating elements can be engineered according to the required power output and environmental conditions.</p><p>Dehaghani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> introduced another novel metal matrix composite (MMC) coating-based heating system to solve the issue of ice accretion on wind turbine blades and aircraft wings operating in a cold environment. They used a NiCrAlY metal matrix with different ceramic and cermet reinforcing phases to produce the electrical heating elements using thermal spray techniques and the effect of ceramic particle reinforcement on microstructure, electrical properties and heating performance was studied. They observed that the electrical properties of the heating elements were significantly dependent on the ceramic reinforcing phase. The coatings having higher electrical resistance exhibited better heating performance. Given that the amount of supplied power was equal for all the heating systems, it was concluded that certain MMC heating elements could be effectively employed for the reduction of requisite energy consumption for deicing.</p><p>Bobzin et al. developed a heating coating system of TiOx/Cr2O3 for their potential use in mould tempering in injection moulding. The coatings were found to endure up to 10,000 thermal cycles between 60°C to 150°C without degeneration and showed homogeneous surface temperature distributions. A following work by the same research group developed a multi-layer coating system for measurement of the temperature of the injection moulding tool surface by utilising the temperature-sensitive semiconducting TiOx/Cr2O3 coating between two isolated Al2O3 and electrically contacted with NiCr coatings outside the isolation coatings. They concluded that TiOx/Cr2O3 can be employed as a functional coating for temperature sensing by monitoring its resistivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. A recent work pursued by the same research group explored the feasibility of HEA as thermal spray heating elements. They explored the electrical properties of melt-spun tape of thirteen different compositions of Al0.5CoCrFeNiZrxSiy. They observed that the addition of Zr to the popularly investigated Al0.5CoCrFeNi alloy increases the resistivity. Although the addition of Si has no considerable effect on resistivity it has good phase stability up to 600 °C. They have proposed that Al0.5CoCrFeNiZr0.2Si0.2 HEA with high electrical resistivity and phase stability up to 600 °C could be a potential alternative to current heating elements (ITSC Conference Paper) <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>.</p></div>

Material removal due to solid particle erosion is a consequence of a series of essentially independent but similar impact events with the contact between the hard particles and the component surface being of very short duration.

The advantage of coatings is that they are relatively cheap and can be applied in situ. Choosing the best coating process of all the different deposition techniques available depends on the functional requirements, adaptability of the coating material to the technique intended, the desired level of adhesion (size, shape, and metallurgy of the substrate), availability and cost of manufacturing. In general, widely used techniques to obtain coatings include weld overlay, diffusion coatings, CVD/PVD coatings, thermal spraying and laser cladding. extremely resistant to SPE it is difficult to implement them in practice as they require high deposition temperatures which exceed the permissible limits of metallic components <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>.</p><p>Hence, TiN-based in monolithic or multilayer forms that can be deposited on relevant substrates are usually used <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>.

The erosion resistance was 2-3 times better than the uncoated 316L stainless steel specimen at higher temperatures and impact angles of 30° and 90°. Both coatings exhibited a mixed mode of material removal with the HVOF coating offering higher erosion resistance than the APS coating because of its lower porosity, greater splat adhesion, a lower degree of decarburisation and higher inter-splat sintering at elevated temperatures.

Thus, the WC-10Co-4Cr coating, with a higher hardness to elastic modulus ratio, exhibits a smaller erosive wear rate than the WC-12Co coating.As such as the hardness to elastic modulus ratio increases, the erosive wear rate of the coating due to the impact of small SiC particles decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.9.">Motivation</head><p>The summary of the various research works presented throughout Chapter 1 has proven that this new class of metallic alloys the high entropy alloy has outperformed most conventional alloys.</p><p>However, their physical properties have not yet been fully explored. The superior properties of the HEA coatings that have been reported and the many other properties that have not yet been pursued have motivated the candidate to explore the new avenue of electrical and heating properties of flame sprayed HEA coatings. During this work, it also came to light that the multifunctional aspects of HEA have not been conceived. It is expected that the erosive wear of heating coatings will result in a change in performance. Thus, getting an estimate of the erosion rate will help in the development of superior erosion-resistant heating coatings for future applications. The ingenuity of this work essentially lies in the exploration and investigation of the multifaceted aspect of novel flame sprayed High Entropy Alloy coatings.</p></div>

Chapter 1 provides a comprehensive review of the various aspects of this project highlighting the previous results and prospects.</p><p>Beginning with an introduction and background of HEA, Chapter 1 moves on to highlight the exceptional properties of HEAs. It then discusses the manufacturing of HEA coatings and their applications using different techniques including thermal spray. Following this, the review of the existing literature on TS HEA suggests its feasibility as an efficacious manufacturing technique.</p><p>The readers are then introduced to functional i.e. resistive heating thermal spray coating and an overview of the progress in this field has been presented. Following this, to explore the possible multi-functional aspect of HEA coatings an introduction to solid particle erosion and the factors influencing the rate of erosion has been presented. A summary of each section has been provided at the end to highlight the most important aspects that have motivated the conceptualization of this work.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Coating Fabrication</head><p>Commercially available stainless steel 316L (Metal Supermarkets, Edmonton, AB, Canada) was used as a substrate in this study. Prior to deposition, the substrates were grit blasted with #24 alumina grit (Manus Abrasive Systems Inc., Edmonton, AB, Canada) to remove impurities and to enhance the roughness of the coatings for better coating adhesion. Pre-alloyed AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW, and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA feedstocks were deposited on stainless steel 316L substrates using an oxy-acetylene flame spray torch (6PII, Oerlikon Metco, Westbury, NY, USA) equipped with a volumetric powder feeder (5MPE, Oerlikon Metco, Westbury, NY, USA). In order to avoid conductivity and short-circuiting during the Joule heating experiments, an insulating layer of alumina -45 𝑡𝑜 + 5 𝜇𝑚 (AMDRY 6060, Oerlikon Metco, Westbury, NY, USA) was deposited on to the substrates before the deposition of HEA layers. The flame spray torch was manoeuvred using a fixed robot assembly (HP-20, Motoman Yaskawa Electric Corp, Waukegan, IL, USA) to ensure the consistency and repeatability of deposition. The optimized parameters have been listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. For all specimens, two passes of alumina and two passes of the HEAs were performed to produce the coatings. At least three coatings were produced for each test. </p></div>

The cross-sectioned specimens were grounded using silicon carbide grit papers (180 to 1200) (LECO, Mississauga, ON, Canada), followed by polishing using diamond slurries of 3 𝜇𝑚 and 1 𝜇𝑚 (LECO, Mississauga, ON, Canada), respectively. Specimens were cleaned using alcohol and acetone to remove diamond residues before microstructural investigations. The microstructures and chemical compositions of the HEA coatings were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM)</p><p>equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (SEM, Zeiss Sigma 300 VP-FE, Carl Zeiss Canada Ltd., Toronto, ON, Canada) using a voltage of 15kV. A backscattered (BSE) detector was used to capture the micrographs, which were qualitatively analyzed using image analysis (ImagePro, Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) to evaluate the porosity and thickness. At least ten micrographs were used to determine the average values of porosity and thickness. Phases were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Ultima IV diffractometer Rigaku, Akishima-Shi, TYO, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.546 Å) scanning from 20° to 100° at a rate of 2°/min.</p></div>

A data acquisition system (SCXI-1600, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) was used to determine the current, voltage and temperature at a frequency of 10 Hz (10 data points per second). Before conducting the tests, the four-point Kelvin connection technique was employed to measure the electrical resistance of all the samples using a digital multimeter (34461A Digital Multimeter, 6 ½ Digit, Keysight Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)</head><p>The XRD profiles of the feedstock powders have been shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref>. All the three HEA powders show the presence of BCC1 and BCC2 phases. The BCC1 phase is rich in Al, Co, Cr and Fe in the case of AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW HEA powder and has a lattice parameter of about 2.86 Å. For AlCoCrFeMo HEA powder the BCC1 phase also has a rich content of V and a lattice parameter of 2.87 Å. This is consistent with the observations made by other researchers where the addition of Al in addition to Fe and Cr promotes the formation of BCC phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">178]</ref>.</p><p>The BCC2 phase is Mo rich phase with a lattice parameter of 3.14 Å present in both AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoV. On the other hand, the BCC2 phase rich in Mo and W is formed in AlCoCrFeMoW HEA powder. An earlier study by Nair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> suggested that the higher atomic radius of Mo (0.139 nm) and the medium enthalpy of mix of Mo with the other components might be responsible for the limited solubility in AlCoCrFe BCC structure. The similarity in the atomic radius of W and Mo leads to the formation of Mo-W rich BCC phase in AlCoCrFeMo HEA powder.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">13</ref> shows the XRD profiles of the flame-sprayed HEA coatings. All coatings show the presence of mixed oxides and BCC phases. This aligns well with the results previously reported by Nair et al. 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> in their study of flame-sprayed AlCoCrFeMo HEA. Similar results were also reported by Meghawal et al. for AlCoCrFeNi fabricated via air plasma spraying <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref> and by Patel et al for CoCrFeMnNi high-velocity oxy-fuel coatings <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154]</ref>. When the XRD profiles of the HEA coatings (in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">13</ref>.) are compared with those of the HEA powders (in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref>.) it is noted that the peaks shift to a higher angle in the coatings. This may be attributed to the lattice strains and changes in composition associated with oxide formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. However, only a minor peak shift is observed in the AlCoCrFeMoW HEA coating when compared to the AlCoCrFeMoW HEA powder. This is probably because of the higher melting point of W compared to the other elements as a result of which it is unable to fuse completely to bring about significant changes. The presence, of unmolten and partially molten particles rich in W, have been observed in the SEM images.  The broadening of peaks in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">13</ref>. is suggestive of the presence of amorphous structures which can be accounted for by the presence of oxides and intermetallics. Quantitative phase analysis by X-Ray (Rietveld -RIR analysis) has confirmed the presence of a notable amount of oxide and intermetallic phases in AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV compositions. The major oxides found for AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoV is a spinel oxide (AB2O4, where A=Fe, B=Co) having a lattice parameter of 8.264 Å and Al2O3. Approximately 24% and 17% of spinel oxides were present in AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoV respectively. However, no presence of spinel oxides was found in AlCoCrFeMoW. Also, the total percentage of oxide formed in AlCoCrFeMoW was 52% and 39% lower as compared to AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoV. The major oxide formed in AlCoCrFeMoW is of ABO4 type which is of monoclinic nature (lattice constants a=4.947, a/b= 0.870, c/b= 0.821) with A, B being Co, W, Fe, or Al. Moreover, a negligible amount of Al2O3 was observed in AlCoCrFeMoW. The results of RIR analysis suggest that W tends to preferentially combine with Co, Al and Mo to form complex intermetallics of cubic nature. V on the other hand preferentially combines with Al and Fe resulting in an intermetallic having a BCC-like structure.</p><p>The presence of iron-chromium intermetallic has also been noted in AlCoCrFeMoV. On addition of W and V to AlCoCrFeMo, there is a peak shift happening to the left. The peak has shifted from 2θ = 46° for AlCoCrFeMo to 2θ = 43° for AlCoCrFeMoV and 2θ = 40° for AlCoCrFeMoW. The shift to a lower angle is more pronounced in AlCoCrFeMoW. This shifting is attributed to the lattice strains caused due changes in chemical composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>. The lattice constants calculated are 2.78 Å, 3.18 Å and 2.97 Å for AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW, and AlCoCrFeMoV respectively. Thus, the addition of tungsten with an atomic radius of 0.139 nm which is higher than all other elements in the given composition causes severe lattice distortion which results in straining and an ultimate peak shift.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">SEM</head><p>The backscattered cross-sectional SEM micrographs of the three different HEA coatings at low and high magnification have been shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">14</ref>. The typical splat morphology and lamellar structure of the flame-sprayed coatings are evident in all three coatings.</p><p>higher magnifications indicate the presence of multiple contrasting regions comprising white, grey and dark grey regions. Additionally, the presence of partially molten, un-molten particles and interlamellar cracks are also observed. The presence of partial and un-molten particles could be due to splashing and fragmentation during the impact of large/medium-sized particles on the substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. Nair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref> and Ang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref> in their studies on flame-sprayed AlCoCrFeMo and plasma sprayed AlCoCrFeNi and MnCoCrFeNi, respectively have reported the presence of similar microstructure. As observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">14</ref>. there is no observed discontinuity or delamination at the interface between the HEA and alumina layer coating, suggesting proper adhesion between the layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. There is also no evidence of penetration of the HEA layer into the alumina layer in any case.</p><p>The apparent porosity and average coating thickness for the three HEA coatings as well as the alumina layer (common in all three coatings) have been reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. It can be seen that all the three HEA coatings have similar thickness and porosity levels. The alumina layer shows the presence of inter-connected elongated pores and has a significantly higher level of porosity as compared to the HEA coatings. The lack of fusion between the sprayed particles of alumina which has a high melting point of 2054°C could account for the higher porosity levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>. The porosity is also highly dependent on the feedstock powder size and increases with an increase in the size of the feedstock powder <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref> thus, the difference in the particle diameters will add to the porosity.</p><p>However, the presence of high porosity in the alumina layer is desirable as it contributes to the efficiency in electrical insulation. To quantify the chemical composition of the phases and oxides EDS analysis and elemental distribution mapping were done and is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">15</ref>. The three different contrasting regions observed in each coating has been labelled and their respective chemical composition in atomic percentages have been reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. Presence of high amount of oxygen is noted in all regions. The evolution of oxides due to the in-flight oxidation of powder particles is a characteristic feature of high-temperature processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">156]</ref>.</p><p>The dark grey region (denoted by 3, 2, and 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">15</ref>. 5 a, b, and c respectively) are oxides of aluminium as noted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. The light grey regions comprise of mixed oxides of the different elements. The bright white regions in all three coatings are depleted of Al and contain a high amount of Mo and an almost equal amount of Co, Cr, Fe, W (in the case of AlCoCrFeMoW) and V (in case of AlCoCrFeMoV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>. This suggests the presence of mixed oxide embedded BCC phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. These observations are well in accordance with the XRD results reported in the previous section. The strong affinity of the HEA components to bond with oxygen is possible due to the p-d bonding of Al, Fe and Cr with oxygen. The high enthalpy of formation of Al2O3 (-1676 kJ mol -1 ) results in the evolution of Al-based dominant oxide phases in the flame spray coatings <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. </p></div>

As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">16</ref>.</p><p>AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings showed an average hardness of approximately 592 ± 58 HV. The obtained microhardness also outperforms the AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings fabricated through the cold spray technique, reported previously by Nair et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. However, the addition of W to AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings showed a slight improvement of about 3% in microhardness value.</p><p>On the other hand, AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings exhibited the highest average hardness value of around 714 ± 64 HV, which was approximately 17% and 20% higher than that of AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings, respectively. Higher hardness achieved for the AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings could be attributed to concurrent interactions of BCC phases and intermetallics coupled with the existence of oxide inclusions. Prior studies also reported the influence of hard intermetallic phases on high microhardness values <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. In addition, the high misfit of the atomic radius of the constituent elements may contribute to an increase in hardness for the AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings. The Al (0.143 nm), Mo (0.139 nm), W (0.139 nm) and V (0.136 nm) exhibits high atomic radius than Co (0.125nm), Cr (0.128 nm), and Fe (0.126 nm), which facilitate lattice distortion, which eventually may lead to solid-solution strengthening, thus, high hardness. Similar behaviour by the influence of vanadium (V) on both the FCC Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-V and BCC Cr-Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W-Hf-Ti-Zr families of the high-entropy alloy was reported previously by Yin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>. They have concluded from their work that the presence of vanadium is the key to high strength in both FCC and BCC high entropy alloys and have attributed this to the uniqueness in the atomic volume of vanadium in both BCC and FCC crystals vis-à-vis larger in FCC and smaller in bcc HEAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>. Solid solution strengthening due to the mismatch in atomic sizes is a primary cause of the high strength and hardness of HEAs in general. The amount of oxides follow the trend</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> listed the average electrical resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistance recorded after the completion of the test.

The was found for the physical vapour deposition of AlCoCrFeNi HEA coatings, reported previously by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Their study reported that the high atomic radius of Al (0.143 nm) facilitated the topological distortion in the lattice structure, contributing to an increase in electrical resistivity for the HEA coatings. In addition, HEAs exhibit transition metals with a high concentration of point defects resulting from multi-principal elements in a pseudo-unitary lattice cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">163]</ref>. These intrinsic structural defects induce pronounced scattering of electrons, contributing to higher electrical resistivity for the HEA coatings compared to that of conventional Ni-20Cr coatings. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">19</ref>. shows the correlation of electrical resistivity with the weight fractions of oxides in HEA coatings. An apparent correlation of Adj.

This correlation suggests that the evolution of oxides due to oxidation in-flight has a strong dependence on the electrical resistivity of the HEA coatings. AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings exhibited high weight fraction of oxides approximately 70%, followed by AlCoCrFeMoV (~55%) and AlCoCrFeMoW HEA coatings (~30%), respectively. According to literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> transition, metal-based oxides are typically non-stoichiometric compounds, which have been found to follow general behaviour as a semiconductor. Furthermore, all the HEA coatings exhibited a negative temperature coefficient of resistance as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. A negative temperature coefficient of resistance is suggesting the decrease in resistivity of the materials with an increase in temperature. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings showed the least value approximately 3.82 × 10 -4 °𝐶-1 , which was 102% and 732% lower than that of AlCoCrFeMoV and AlCoCrFeMoW HEA coatings, respectively. Research studies have reported the occurrence of negative TCR values in the case of many disordered alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref>. As mentioned previously, the evolution of the high fraction of oxides due to oxidation in-flight acts as a semiconductor, wherein, electrons in the valence band get excited and jump to the conduction band due to an increase in temperature, contributing to a negative temperature coefficient of resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref>. According to Mott (1964), the s-d scattering of electrons depends on the temperature, expressed in the equation 7.</p><p>𝜌 𝑠-𝑑 = 1 -(</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝜋 2 6 ) ( 𝑇 𝑇 0 ) 2<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where 𝑘𝑇 0 = 𝐸 0 -𝐸 𝐹 , 𝑘 is the Boltzmann Constant, 𝐸 0 and 𝐸 𝐹 are Fermi Energy of the d-band at 0 K and T K temperatures. Based on the equation 7, the increase in temperature (T) decreases the resistivity (𝜌 𝑠-𝑑 ) of the materials, suggesting a negative coefficient of temperature. Hence, as presented in the results, the evolution of oxides and underlying microstructure coupled with topological lattice distortion associated with large atomic size misfit appears to be the primary responsible factor for improvement in electrical resistivity for all the HEA coatings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Joule Heating Performance</head><p>Joule heating, also known as Ohmic or resistive heating, is the generation of heat in a metal as a result of passing electrical current through the metal over a voltage difference. Under free heat convection conditions, heat may be lost from the coating substrate ensemble as a result of fluid movement due to pressure and density gradients in the air. The air velocities near the coatingsubstrate system are low, with the majority of air remaining stagnant. On supplying electrical power, the surface temperatures of the coating increased beyond the ambient temperature due to the generation of heat by Joule heating. The Joule heating performance of the coatings has been compared based on the rate of increase in surface temperature for given power input. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">20</ref> shows the variation in surface temperature as a function of time during Joule heating of the coatings under free convection. For the purpose of comparison, Ni-20Cr has been utilized in the present investigation. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">20</ref>, it is apparent that the surface temperatures show a linear dependency on time. A linear regression of 99% was found for all the coatings. The slope of the curve corresponding to the rate of change in temperature was calculated and plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">21</ref>. A more rapid change in the rate of increase in temperature is observed at higher powers. The rate of increase in temperature becomes ten times when the power is increased from 3.5 to 35 and two times when the power is doubled from 35 to 75 W. This is expected as more energy is being delivered to the system at higher powers. It should be noted that all the HEA coatings have a higher rate of increase in surface temperature ranging between 2.5 to 3.3 times that of Ni-20Cr, as observed in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">21</ref>. However, the variation in performance between the HEAs themselves is minuscule. The addition of W and V to AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings can result in either an increase in the Joule heating performance up to 2% or a decrease to 9% depending on the power input. At low power of 3.5W, AlCoCrFeMoW HEA coatings have a relatively better (~2%)</p><p>performance. This may be because of the lower resistance of AlCoCrFeMoW which allows a larger current to flow resulting in a greater amount of heat generated as given by equation 4. However, when the power increases from 3.5 to 35 W there is a drop in the temperature values for AlCoCrFeMoW after about 10 minutes as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">21</ref>. A similar trend for AlCoCrFeMoW can also be seen after 8 minutes of power being supplied at 75W (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">21</ref>). It is also observed that there is a noticeable increase in the temperature values recorded for AlCoCrFeMoV at 75 W. Local changes in the structure like the formation of quasi-stable atomic clusters at elevated temperatures can lead to a decrease in electrical resistivity which will then allow more current to pass resulting in more heat being generated <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref>. Advanced characterization like in-situ TEM would be required to support the claims. When a similar amount of electrical energy (power) is given to each of the systems, the HEAs can reach a higher maximum temperature as compared to Ni-20Cr. The stark difference in the Joule heating performance and the higher maximum temperatures attained could be attributed to the difference in resistance (resistivity) values observed between the HEAs and Ni-20Cr coatings. Paired t-tests were conducted between the three HEA coatings and Ni-20Cr to identify the material with the best performance. The number of data points analyzed were less than 30 hence, it is assumed that the samples follow the t-distribution thus, justifying the use of the t-statistic for hypothesis testing 2 . To get an accurate comparison between materials and get a better estimation of p-values, resampling is applied to experimental results to increase the sample size for each material to 10. The null hypothesis was chosen as: "there is no significant difference in Joule heating performance between material 1 and material 2." The python code employed to compute the statistics has been included in Appendix. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> indicates the p-value for each pair. A p-value (the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed) is lesser than the α value of 0.05 would indicate the presence of a significant difference. It can be seen that the p-value is greater than 0.05 when comparing the three HEA coatings themselves. However, the p-value is lesser than 0.05 when each of the HEA coatings is compared with Ni-20Cr. Thus, we can conclude statistically that all three HEA coatings have a better Joule heating performance than Ni-20Cr but no significant difference in performance between themselves. Hence, other factors like high-temperature properties, fracture, corrosion and fatigue resistance could be investigated to ascertain the best material for the given application. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Solid Particle Erosion</head><p>The solid particle erosion rates in terms of volume loss of material per unit mass of erodent particle as a function of impact angle for the three flame-sprayed HEA coatings have been shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">23</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">22</ref>. is indicative of the difference in the shape of the eroded area obtained at different impact angles. The eroded surface area as expected is elliptical at 30° and circular at 90°. Although the eroded area appears to be large at 30° more volume loss of material i.e., a higher erosion rate has been recorded at an impact angle of 90° as compared to 30°. Erosion rates were 21%, 23 % and 29% lower for AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV respectively at an impact angle of 30° as compared to 90°. This suggests that the coatings undergo a brittle mode of erosion <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Brittle erosion develops in hard materials (such as ceramics) due to the formation of crack networks, and these materials erode quickly at normal incidence ( impact angle =90°) <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. The limited number of active slip systems in BCC structures coupled with the complexity of atomic arrangement and difference in the bonding enthalpy of near neighbour atoms in HEA could hinder the movement of dislocations resulting in increased hardness and brittleness <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">178,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">181]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">24</ref>. shows the SEM micrographs of the eroded AlCoCrFeMo HEA coated specimens under the three different testing conditions at low and high magnifications. The eroded surface morphology at an impact angle of 30° has characteristic ploughing marks and lips. The presence of pits, microindents and a few cracks have also been observed. In contrast, the surface eroded at normal incidence (90°) shows the presence of large craters, wide cracks, micro-indents and lips.   The ratio of particle hardness to target hardness is known to have a strong controlling influence on the erosion mechanism. When this ratio is greater than 1 it results in indentation-induced fractures <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. This ratio in our case is evidently greater than 1(hardness of sand particle approximately around 1500 to 1700 HV and coatings between 594 to 750 HV) leading to erosion by splat ejection and indentation-induced material removal. The erosion at an oblique impact angle of 30° is dominated by ploughing and cutting. As observed from the eroded surface morphology at oblique impact angles, the surface of the coatings is first cut by the erodent particles due to large horizontal stress to form furrows. The continuous impact of erosion particles then leads to the extrusion of materials to the edge and the formation of lips. The extrusion lip keeps accumulating material and deforming until it is removed from the surface by fracture. At vertical impact angles loss in material occurs due to the constant impact in the form of indents. The erodent particle impacting the surface of the coating at a normal angle result in the formation of microindents and the initiation of cracks. These cracks grow and propagate during subsequent continuous impact leading to the flaking of materials and the formation of craters. Thus, the major erosion mechanism at a vertical angle is dominated by cracking and crater formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">26</ref> depicts the rate of erosion at room and elevated temperatures for the three HEA coatings.</p><p>A quick look suggests the absence of a significant difference between the erosion rate at room and elevated temperatures.

The number of data points analyzed were less than 30 hence, it is assumed that the samples follow the t-distribution thus, justifying the use of the t-statistic for hypothesis testing<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> . t-tests statistically ascertain the difference in the averages of two populations and can be used to determine the equality or relative inequality of respective population means based on sample information <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref>.</p><p>The null hypothesis was chosen as: "there is no significant difference in the mean erosion rate between samples eroded at room temperature and at an elevated temperature of 250 °C." It has been assumed that the two distributions have the same variance. The sample sizes were equal and the tests were performed at a 5% level of significance i.e. 𝛼 = 0.05. The obtained p-values have been indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>. Details of the Independent two-sample t-test and the python code used to generate the results have been included in Appendix A. The p-values (the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed) obtained for all three materials were greater than the 𝛼 value of 0.05 thus confirming the null hypothesis. The t-test results thus provide evidence at a 5% level of significance that there is no difference in the erosion rates at room and elevated temperatures of 250 °C for all the three HEA coatings. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">9</ref>. Shows the p-values of the results of the independent t-test assuming equal variances. The null hypothesis was chosen as: "there is no significant difference in the mean erosion rate between samples eroded at room temperature and an elevated temperature of 250 °C."</p><p>These HEA coatings have a high melting point (AlCoCrFeMo ≈ 1632°C, AlCoCrFeMoW ≈ 1930°C, AlCoCrFeMoV ≈ 1678 °C as calculated using the rule of mixtures) and thus the temperature required to reach the point of thermal softening point which is approximately 0.3 to 0.5 𝑇 𝑚 (melting Temperature) is well above 250 °C. Although no significant differences were observed at 250 °C the trend in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">26</ref>. could be suggestive an of increase in the rate of erosion at temperatures greater than 500°C or more. The thermal softening effect at elevated temperatures could result in a decrease in strength, hardness and impact resistance AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW coatings leading to higher erosion at elevated temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>. Evaluation of erosion rate at higher temperatures and high-temperature mechanical properties would be required to corroborate the aforementioned rationale. The erosion mechanism at elevated temperatures expectedly is similar to what has been described earlier for the erosion at 30° and room temperature When comparing the erosion rates amongst the coatings themselves it is observed that AlCoCrFeMo has the best performance followed by AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV under all testing conditions. The observed trend in the erosion rates is different from the hardness trend wherein AlCoCrFeMoV had the highest hardness followed by AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMo.</p><p>This suggests that higher hardness does not necessarily imply better erosion resistance and other factors like strength, ductility and toughness have a significant impact on the abrasion, impact and erosion wear properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. Paired t-tests were conducted between the three HEA coatings to quantify their individual difference and identify the material with the best performance. To get an accurate comparison between materials and get a better estimation of p-values, resampling is applied to experimental results to increase the sample size for each material to 50. The null hypothesis was chosen as:</p><p>"there is no significant difference in the mean erosion rate between sample 1 and sample 2." The detailed procedure and python code can be found in Appendix A. Hence, the addition of W to AlCoCrFeMo results in no significant changes in erosive wear performance whereas the addition of V to AlCoCrFeMo increases the rate of erosive wear.</p><p>A strong co-relation value of Adj. R 2 = 93% for AlCoCrFeMo, Adj. R 2 = 92% for AlCoCrFeMoW and Adj. R 2 = 99% for AlCoCrFeMoV was found between the 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio which signifies the material's ability to resist strain to failure and the erosion rate. The H/E ratio is a measure of the elastic strain to break and is strongly correlated with energy dissipation in mechanical contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. The 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio has been found to be proportional to the index of plasticity through a linear relationship given by equation 8. </p><p>As observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">27</ref>, the solid particle erosion rate decreases with the increasing value of 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio of the coatings. Thus, AlCoCrFeMo which has the highest 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio shows the lowest erosion rate under given conditions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 4: Conclusion and Summary</head><p>This thesis study explored the feasibility of using flame spraying as a potential manufacturing technique for high entropy alloys coatings. The mechanical and physical properties of the as fabricated flame sprayed coatings were then analyzed for potential multi-functional applications. The major outcomes of the study have been summarized below.</p><p>• Novel equiatomic AlCoCrFeMo, AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings having an approximate thickness of 150 µm were fabricated by flame spraying on 316 L stainless steel substrates.</p><p>• The microstructure of the HEA coatings was characterized using XRD, SEM and EDS.</p><p>The HEA coatings showed BCC solid solution structures with the presence of mixed oxide regions due to oxidation in-flight.</p><p>• Vicker's microhardness tests indicated that the AlCoCrFeMoV HEA coatings has the highest average hardness followed by AlCoCrFeMoW and AlCoCrFeMo HEA coatings.</p><p>Improvement in hardness is due to solid solution strengthening, BCC phases and a high fraction of oxide regions.</p><p>• Electrical characterization has shown that the flame sprayed HEA coatings exhibited high resistivity and negative thermal coefficient of resistance because of the large lattice distortions and s-d scattering of electrons.</p><p>• The Joule heating studies have exhibited that the heating performance of all the three HEA coatings was 2 to 3 times better than that of flame sprayed Ni-20Cr. However, the three HEA coatings themselves showed similar heating performance at ambient temperature and free convection conditions. The improved performance has been attributed to the difference in electrical resistivity observed for Ni-20Cr and the HEA coatings.</p><p>• The nanoindentation studies showed that AlCoCrFeMo has a higher elastic strain to break-𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio compared to the other two coatings because of its exceptionally lower elastic modulus compared to the other two materials.</p><p>• Solid Particle Erosion studies have shown that the rate of erosion for all three HEA coatings depends on the impact angle. A higher rate of erosion was observed at an impact angle of 90° in comparison to 30° suggesting a brittle mode of failure.</p><p>• The erosion rate of all three coatings was found to be independent of temperature on testing up to 250 °C.</p><p>• It was statistically determined that AlCoCrFeMo and AlCoCrFeMoW coatings have better solid particle erosion resistance than the AlCoCrFeMoV coatings.</p><p>• The AlCoCrFeMoV coatings having the highest hardness had the least favourable erosion properties thus high hardness doesn't necessarily imply high erosion resistance. The erosion rate of the coatings was found to be linearly dependent on the 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ (elastic strain to break) ratio and decreased with increasing value of 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio.</p><p>algorithms based on the Monte-Carlo time series approach could be employed to predict the value of stable electrical resistivity and the ideal heat treatment temperature and duration. The train the model it will be fed with the data for the change in resistance with temperatures for ten heating cycles initially for a given coating. The predicted outcomes of the model can then be verified with a subsequent limited number of experimentations.</p><p>In this initial study of the flame sprayed HEA coatings for heating applications the coatings were deposited over rectangular-shaped samples. Electrical components often have complex shapes and patterns. The issue of failure of the complex or patterned coatings at high operating temperatures due to the development of thermal stresses is of great concern from the industrial application point of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>. Thus, studying the fatigue, creep and failure properties of complex/patterned thermal sprayed HEA would be essential to understanding the practical feasibility of the proposed application.</p><p>The high electrical resistivity observed for the flame-sprayed coatings in this work has been attributed to the inherent nature of HEA (i.e., lattice distortion, disorder), the presence of oxides and other microstructural defects like pores. However, the single most significant factor or the relative influence of each of these factors has not been established. To understand the influence of oxides and porosity on the electrical resistivity HEA coatings having different oxide and porosity could be manufactured using different thermal spray techniques like cold spray and HVOF and their properties compared.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>v</head><label></label><figDesc>PrefaceParts of Chapter 2 sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 and parts of chapter 3, sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been published in the conference paper: "Pal S., Nair BR., McDonald A.,2020:" Influence of microstructure on hardness and electric resistivity of flame sprayed high entropy alloy coatings."

A direct current (DC) power supply (1902B DC, B&amp;K Precision Corporation, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) with a maximum voltage and current specification of 60 V and 15 A was employed to generate voltage differences within the heating elements. The data to study the temperature dependence of resistance was collected during self-heating of the samples, i.e., recording the values of flowing currents and the corresponding voltage drops across the resistor when operating as a heater.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_20"><head>Table 8 .</head><label>8</label><figDesc>Indicating the microhardness, nano hardness, elastic moduli, 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ and 𝐻 3 𝐸2  ⁄ of the different coating systems under study.The microhardness values reported earlier have been converted to GPa by multiplying by 0.009807 (Gordon calculator reference) and included in Table8. Compared to the nanohardness the Vickers microhardness values measured seem to be lower. This was anticipated and can be attributed to the indentation size effect (ISE) because of the relatively low load (5 mN) that was used to measure the nanohardness compared to the higher load (300 gf = 2.94 N) used to measure the Vicker's microhardness. According to the indentation size effect (ISE), the generation of strain fields under the smaller indent areas leads to dislocations that are responsible for higher hardness. The Vicker's microhardness measurement is however provides a better indication of the macroscopic properties as it is a calculated balance of different the different microstructural artefacts like phases, porosity and defects that are characteristics of thermal spray processes. On the other hand, because of the small indent size and precise positioning of the indent in nanoindentation defects have minimal impact on the observed values. It thus provides the hardness values of specific phases. The high variability in the nanoindentation results is because the values depend on the individual phase structure and compositions and positioning of the indent within the microstructure.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Micro-Hardness</cell><cell>Nano-Hardness</cell><cell>Elastic Modulus</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Material</cell><cell>(GPa)</cell><cell>(GPa)</cell><cell>(GPa)</cell><cell>𝑯 𝑬 ⁄</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>n = 30</cell><cell>n = 20</cell><cell>n = 20</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>AlCoCrFeMo</cell><cell>5.806 ± 0.568</cell><cell>7.956 ± 2.109</cell><cell>57.751 ± 7.556</cell><cell>0.137773</cell></row><row><cell>AlCoCrFeMoW</cell><cell>6.296 ± 0.5198</cell><cell cols="2">13.927 ± 7.969 112.723 ± 37.728</cell><cell>0.123552</cell></row><row><cell>AlCoCrFeMoV</cell><cell>7.002 ± 0.627</cell><cell cols="2">15.518 ± 6.442 138.125 ± 23.277</cell><cell>0.112321</cell></row></table></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Solid Particle Erosion</head><p>A modified version of the ASTM G-76 standard was used to evaluate the erosion resistance of the HEA coatings. A cold gas dynamic spray system (SST Series P, CenterLine Ltd., Windsor, ON, Canada) was used to accelerate the erodent particles at ambient gas temperatures. The operating parameters have been listed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Garnet sand (Super Garnet, V.V. Mineral, Tamil Nadu, India) having an angular morphology and approximate particle diameter of 349 ± 57 µm (n=30) was chosen as the erodent medium. Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>. shows the SEM micrograph of the sand particles used in the study. The velocity of the erodent particles at the nozzle exit is estimated to be in the range of 65 to 73 m/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> The erosion testing was performed at two different impact angles 30° and 90° at ambient temperature. Erosion tests were also conducted at elevated temperatures and an impact angle of 30° by heating the substrates to 250° C with the help of cartridge heaters (50  AlCoCrFeMoW the splats are thicker and more rounded. Tungsten (W) which has a high melting point of 3695 K when added to AlCoCrFeMo results in incompletely melting of the feedstock powder particles before impacting the substrate and consequently rounder splats. The images at AlCoCrFeMo (~70%) &gt; AlCoCrFeMoV (~55%) &gt; AlCoCrFeMoW (~33%) whereas, the amount of intermetallics follows the trend AlCoCrFeMoW (~48%) &gt; AlCoCrFeMoV (~28%) &gt; AlCoCrFeMo (~12%). Thus, the presence of both oxides and intermetallics in optimal amount might be the reason for the higher strength in AlCoCrFeMoV. (𝑊 𝑝 +𝑊 𝑒 ) is the dimensionless plasticity index and x is a constant. Generally, a higher 𝐻 𝐸 ⁄ ratio implies an increased likelihood of elasticity dominated deformation and has been proposed to control SPE in terms of the transferred energy to the coated surface through the indentation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">174]</ref>. For most electrical applications a stable value of resistance is desired. It is anticipated that heat treating the coatings at the ideal temperature for the required amount of time will result in the formation of stable microstructures which will not be further affected by changes in temperature thus leading to stable electrical resistivity. However, it can be time-consuming to figure out the exact heat treatment temperature and duration. Also, the repeated fabrication and heating tests would result in a lot of waste of materials and energy. Hence, advanced machine learning</p><p>The high-strength flame spray HEA coatings which showed 2 to 3 times better Joule heating performance than conventional Ni-20Cr coatings could be tested for the efficacy in the de-icing process <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">177]</ref>. Ice accretion on the surface of aircraft wings, turbine blades or carbon steel pipes could result in mechanical degradation of the components besides the substantial decrease in performance efficacy and economic losses. Thus, the use of these HEA coatings with superior mechanical and resistive heating performance will be a better alternative.</p></div>
