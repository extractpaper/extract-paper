All cations contribute to the oxide in both conditions, consisting of Cr-rich inner oxide and Fe, Mn, Co and Ni-rich outer oxide. At lower temperature, Ni tends to be trapped at the outer/inner oxide interface, while Ni enriches at the oxide/metal interface at higher temperature in tandem with Cr metal depletion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An expansive composition space for alloy design has been created by the advent of multiprincipal element alloys (MPEAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. MPEAs are typically comprised of five or more elements between 5 and 35 at. %, and are currently being considered for a wide range of structural applications due their exceptional mechanical properties, irradiation resistance, and thermodynamic stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Unique characteristics of these alloys, namely the formation of a single-phase solid solution with a low tendency for precipitation of intermetallic compounds and sluggish solid state diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, make MPEAs intriguing candidates for use in corrosive and oxidizing environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>Many MPEAs have demonstrated favorable corrosion characteristics, which are highly dependent on alloy composition. In conventional alloys, Cr additions (often &gt; 11 at. %) oftentimes aid corrosion resistance, although the Cr content needed for passivation may vary for different alloy systems and environments. These critical Cr additions are responsible for the 'stainless' properties of several conventional alloys (e.g. Ni-Cr, Fe-Cr-Ni, Fe-Cr, and Ni-based super alloys) through the formation of a continuous, protective Cr-rich oxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Numerous MPEAs have Cr concentrations above this threshold, but the presence of several other principal alloying elements could significantly impact passivation behavior, including the critical Cr concentration for passivation, and must be considered.</p><p>Recently, oxide compositions and structures have been explored in various alloys, including the well-known Cantor alloy, a single solid solution FCC phase, equiatomic Fe20Cr20Mn20Ni20Co20 alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.

At higher temperatures (1000-1100 °C), the outer oxide transformed from Mn2O3 to Mn3O4, and an intermediate (Mn,Cr)3O4 ternary oxide was formed, in which Ni, Fe, and Co were in solid solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.

APT needle specimens were made using the focused ion beam lift-out method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, then analyzed (via field evaporation) to remove Ga ion damage, exposing a pristine alloy surface for oxidation. Pristine samples were transferred under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) (10 -7 -10 -8 mbar) to a gas-phase reactor chamber preheated to the desired temperature, where specimens were exposed to O2 gas (99.993% purity) at 10 mbar for 120 °C for 5 minutes and 300 °C for 2 minutes. Specimens were transferred back to the analysis chamber under UHV, where composition across the oxide/metal interface was analyzed. Pressure-temperature-time conditions were selected to develop nanoscale oxides ~2-4 nm thick. A CAMECA local electrode atom probe (LEAP) 4000X HR system operated in laser-pulsing mode was used for data collection. Data were reconstructed and analyzed using the Integrated Visualization and Analysis Software (IVAS), version 3.8.4 by CAMECA.

Oxidation results in a thin layer of mixed metal-oxygen ion complexes of all base alloy components within the first ~5 nm of the specimen apex. Oxidation also occurs along the sides of the specimen, but those features are outside the field of view of the APT reconstruction. Elemental and cation fractions in the base alloy oxides formed after both oxidation conditions are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and compared to the nominal and APT-measured base alloy composition.

A significant change in the Cr atomic fraction in the base alloy (0.23) versus oxides (0.26 and 0.32 after oxidation at 120 °C and 300 °C, respectively) is measured. In contrast, Co and Fe content decrease in the oxide with increasing oxidation temperature. We also find significant Ni in the oxide (≥ 0.36). Interestingly, Ni and Mn concentrations are approximately equal to their base alloy concentrations. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

However, Table <ref type="table">1</ref> does not detail any differences in spatial arrangement of elements, which requires further consideration. 2D compositional contour plots were generated from a sub-volume of APT specimens and are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) and (b) for both oxidation exposures, respectively. The thermal scale uses the same concentration ranges for each oxidation condition to enable a direct visual comparison of the elemental partitioning between oxidation conditions. After oxidation at both temperatures, Ni is present in the oxide, with slight enrichment on the alloy side of the oxide/alloy interface. Cr enrichment is found in the inner oxide for both 120 °C and 300 °C exposures, although to a greater extent in the oxide formed at 300 °C. Fe, Mn, and Co maps all highlight a similar trend for both temperatures of depletion in the inner oxide. Fe, Mn, and Co are also found in the outer oxide after 120 °C oxidation, however this trend was not observed in the contour plots for the oxide formed at 300 °C. It is presumed that the outermost oxide was not captured in the APT reconstruction, resulting in the absence of a clear Fe, Mn, and Co enriched outer oxide that is expected to be present.

Results presented here are repeatable between similar needle specimens and exposure conditions, as shown in Supplemental Information Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>, which also reports as-measured oxygen concentration for reference. Cation fractions for the 120 °C oxide show slight Ni enrichment in the base alloy adjacent to the oxide/metal interface, followed by a decrease in Ni in the Cr-rich inner oxide, and then an increase in Ni (referred to as Ni 'trapping', indicated by the black arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>). Fe, Mn, and Co concentrations are depleted (relative to the base alloy) in the inner oxide, and enriched in the outer oxide.

Important differences are that Ni enrichment in the base alloy is higher and peak Cr enrichment in the inner oxide is greater after 300 °C oxidation (0.48 Ni, 0.39 Cr) versus 120 °C (0.42 Ni, 0.32 Cr).

During room temperature corrosion in an aqueous NaCl environment at pH 4 for 10 ks, the formation of a Cr-rich oxide with small amounts of Ni, Fe, and Mn are observed. One major difference is that the chemical dissolution of Ni, Fe, and Co was observed because single element and spinel type oxides containing these elements are unstable at pH 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The presence of a Cr-rich inner oxide, with Ni, Fe, and Mn also present is consistent with our findings. However, dissolution of some elements in aqueous corrosion leads to the formation of a distinctive outer oxide layer in comparison to that formed in a dry oxidation environment.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3675957 P r e p r i n t n o t p e e r r e v i e w e d Thermodynamically, the oxide formed on the Ni38Fe20Cr22Mn10Co10 MPEA is expected to consist of distinct phases, such as NiO, Cr2O3, Fe2O3, Mn2O3 , (Co, Fe)2O3 and mixed spinels (e.g. (NiFeMnCo)Cr2O4 or NiFe2O4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Such elaborate phase separation from a complex but single phase MPEA requires significant element redistributions that are prohibitive by the short times and low temperatures used here. Hence, the initial oxide is likely a combination of metastable oxides, the formation of which is driven by both thermodynamic and kinetic (e.g. This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3675957 P r e p r i n t n o t p e e r r e v i e w e d mobility) factors. In particular, the diffusivity of elements in the alloy relative to their cation diffusivities in the oxide scale is critical to understanding oxide scale development <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Prior work studying diffusivity of alloying elements in MPEAs has established fastest to slowest diffusers (in the base alloy) are: Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, mobility of these species in complex oxides is an important consideration that is not yet established, where diffusion of cations depends strongly on charge state and local defects, in addition to oxide structure and composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. A study on aqueous corrosion of the same MPEA suggested Cr enrichment in the oxide may be attributed to faster diffusion of Cr in the base alloy in comparison to other alloying elements, and the lower free energy of formation for Cr2O3 versus other transition metal oxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The mismatch in element mobilities can partially explain the Cr depletion is found in the metal adjacent to the oxide/metal interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, but other thermodynamic factors of selective oxidation behavior likely contribute. In this work, Cr enrichment and present of all alloying elements is observed in the inner oxide, however not in sufficient amounts to support consumption of all Cr 3+ as a mixed spinel or corundum <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The distinctly different outer oxide could be formed via diffusion of other alloying elements through and reaction with the Cr-rich inner oxide layer. Ni trapping in the oxide could be related to sluggish diffusivity of Ni relative to other alloying elements in the oxide, and may suggest early stages of spinel formation. In addition, morphology and presence of high diffusivity paths (e.g. pores, grain boundaries) may also influence element redistributions. The presence of nanocrystalline oxide grains formed on needle specimens <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> may facilitate local short-circuit diffusion of oxygen to the base alloy, and also the outward diffusion of cations, particularly Mn, as demonstrated in prior work on Cantor alloy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To summarize, we measured in 3D and at the nanoscale the elemental redistributions that accompany early stages of oxidation in a non-equiatomic, single phase Ni38Fe20Cr22Mn10Co10 (at. %) MPEA. An in situ APT approach was used to track changes in elemental and cation fractions in the alloy and oxide, respectively, for 120 °C-5 minute and 300 °C-2 minute exposures in 10 mbar O2. A layered oxide film is formed for both conditions, comprised of an inner Cr-rich oxide and an outer Fe, Ni, Mn, Co, and Ni-rich oxide. At lower temperatures, stronger Ni trapping is found in the inner oxide, whereas at higher temperatures, stronger Ni-enrichment at the oxide/metal interface occurs. Neither the inner nor outer oxides can be defined as a stoichiometric oxide phase, but more likely consists of metastable oxides that have not yet reached a thermodynamically stable form. The observed Ni-enrichment in the base alloy and the formation of a layered oxide is consistent with the composition of the passive film formed on the same alloy during longer-term corrosion in an aqueous NaCl environment. Our work has implications for alloy design, in which evaluating oxidation or corrosion behavior with higher fidelity than traditional methodologies is needed.</p></div>
