<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Machine learning has been successfully employed in computer vision, speech processing, and natural language processing. However, when machine learning is applied to materials study, many challenges remain, and they include small datasets, tricky manual feature (descriptor) engineering, isolated models and poor interpretability. In this project, possible solutions to these challenges have been explored using deep learning and transfer learning.</p><p>For the challenge of small datasets, fully connected deep neural network and tree-based models were used to predict solidification cracking susceptibility of stainless steels with a dataset of 487 samples. It is found that deep neural network with pre-training and finetuning improves prediction accuracy, and tree-based models reveal the relative importance of input variables.</p><p>To overcome the challenge of tricky manual feature engineering in predicting phase formation in inorganic substances and compounds properties, I proposed a general and transferable deep learning framework as follows: (1) mapping raw data to pseudo images with periodic table structure, (2) automatically extracting features through convolutional neural networks, (3) transferring knowledge by sharing features extractors between models. The proposed deep learning models outperformed previous models in predicting glass-forming ability using a medium dataset of 16k samples and compounds properties using a big dataset of 228k samples. The developed transfer learning model for multi-principal element alloys can distinguish five phases (BCC, FCC, HCP, amorphous, mixture) with high scores (0.94) in a small dataset of 345 samples. The transfer learning model for phase prototypes can discriminate 170 phase prototypes with an accuracy of 0.9 in a dataset of 17k inorganic substances. Periodic table knowledge embedded in data representations and knowledge shared between models is beneficial for tasks with small datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Machine learning is a powerful tool and an important complement to experiment, theory, and modeling. However, there are many challenges in machine learning for materials research: e.g., small datasets, tricky manual feature engineering, poor interpretability, poor transferability. These challenges demand some tailored approaches. How to fully exploit limited data, automatic feature engineering, existing models and domain expertise is the key to effectively applying machine learning in materials research. This thesis shows our attempts to tackle these challenges through deep learning and transfer learning.  2 Literature review on machine learning</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Definition of machine learning</head><p>Machine learning (ML), which is also known as statistical learning, data mining, and pattern recognition, is an important branch of artificial intelligence (AI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> . It is a powerful technique that enables us to build adaptive mathematical models that automatically improve performance through example data or experience without explicit programming. Machine learning, especially its newest progress deep learning (DL), has achieved state-of-art performance in a variety of applications, e.g. search engine, spam email filtering, recommendation system, autonomous vehicles, computer vision (CV), speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP) <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> . It is increasingly being exploited in science researches <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[13]</ref> . The data-based and data-driven method has been recognized as the 4 th paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">14</ref> of science and a essential complement to experiment, theory, and simulation.    Feature transformation involves increasing/decreasing features dimensional e.g., principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Conventional machine learning is a combination of manual feature engineering and shallow leaning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Machine learning workflow</head><p>Deep learning consists of automatic feature engineering and shallow learning. Thus, raw data, e.g., images, are used as direct input. Transfer learning was proposed to share knowledge between different tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">16</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Basic conceptions of machine learning</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Data, classification &amp; regression</head><p>Data is the most important component (lifeblood) for a machine learning system. It can be structured data e.g., Excel datasheets, comma-separated values (CSV) data, and unstructured data e.g., image, text, sound, time serial data.</p><p>A piece of data is also known as one entry, or an example, or an instance, depending on different scenarios. A dataset is a finite set of examples and their corresponding labels (targets). If labels exist for all entries in a dataset, it is a supervised learning task; if no label is available, it is an unsupervised learning task; if only partial labels exist, it is called a semi-supervised learning process. Labels can be numerical-continuous or categorical.</p><p>In the first case, the process is called regression, while in the second, it is called classification. A dataset used in supervised learning can be represented as D = {X, Y}. In a dataset of structured data, input (features, which are also known as attributes and descriptors) can be represented as X = {𝑥 1 ⃗⃗⃗ , 𝑥 2 ⃗⃗⃗⃗ , …, 𝑥 𝑛 ⃗⃗⃗⃗ } where feature vector 𝑥 𝑖 ⃗⃗⃗ ∈ ℝ 𝑚 .</p><p>Output (target) can be represented Y = {𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 , … , 𝑦 𝑛 } where 𝑦 𝑖 ∈ ℝ 1 in single-task problems and 𝑦 𝑖 ∈ ℝ + in multi-task problems).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Training &amp; testing datasets</head><p>In machine learning, a dataset is often split into training and testing datasets. The former is used for training a machine learning model and the latter is used for testing the performances of a trained model. If early-stopping technique is used, a small part of training dataset will be held out as validation dataset. In dataset division, training and testing datasets must reflect the original distribution of the dataset. In machine learning, we need to select the best fit model which is neither underfit nor overfit (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref>.3). The problem of underfitting will appear if we use an excessively simple model to approximate a complex dataset. For example, when the number of neurons is small in a neural network regression, underfitting occurs because the network lacks sufficient internal parameters (ability) to capture the complete characteristics of a dataset. Both training error and testing error are large in underfitting. It can be easily solved by increasing the complexity of model (e.g., increase the number of neurons in a network).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Overfit &amp; underfit</head><p>In overfitting, the training error can be lowered to a very small value, but testing error turn out to be large. It indicates that the network only memorizes the training data, but it has not learned to generalize to new instances. A few techniques have been designed</p><p>to avoid overfitting and improve the generalization, e.g., early stopping, regularization, drop out, batch normalization <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">18</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">Loss function, backpropagation algorithm &amp; regularization</head><p>The training process of many machine learning models e.g., neural network, is a process of minimizing the loss function though updating the internal parameters (e.g. weights and biases) of models. A typical loss function often used in machine learning is mean square error (MSE):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">MSE = 1 𝑁 ∑(𝑒 𝑖 ) 2 𝑁 𝑖=1 = 1 𝑁 ∑(𝑡 𝑖 -𝑎 𝑖 ) 2 𝑁 𝑖=1</formula><p>where 𝑡 𝑖 is the target value and 𝑎 𝑖 is the prediction value of the model based on the input data.</p><p>To improve generalization and reduce the risk of overfitting, a regularized loss function MSEreg, which combines mean square error with mean square weight (MSW), is also usually employed:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑀𝑆𝐸 𝑟𝑒𝑔 = γMSE + (1 -γ)MSW MSW = 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑊 𝑗 2 𝑛 𝑗=1</formula><p>where γ is the performance ratio (a hyper-parameter either given by researchers or automatically determined by optimization algorithm); 𝑊 𝑗 is the j-th weight.</p><p>Minimization of mean square weight entails small values of internal parameters, which assures the model responses smoothly and reduces the risk of overfitting.</p><p>Gradient descent algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">19</ref> (backpropagation algorithm) updates the parameters of a model in the direction in which the loss function decreases most rapidly, i.e. the opposite direction of gradient. In an iteration, parameters are updated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑥 𝑘+1 =𝑥 𝑘 -𝛼 𝑘 𝑔 𝑘</formula><p>where 𝑥 𝑘+1 is the updated parameters, 𝑥 𝑘 is the old parameters, 𝑔 𝑘 is the gradient, and 𝛼 𝑘 is the learning rate.</p><p>Automatic determination of the optimal regularization parameters is always desired.</p><p>Bayesian regularization proposed by MacKay <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">21</ref> gives us a good solution of this type.</p><p>MacKay assumed that the internal parameters of a model are randomly distributed, and the regularization parameters can be estimated by Bayesian inference.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.5">Ensemble and bagging</head><p>The models introduced previously are all so-called strong learners which solve a specific problem by looking for the best possible solution. Another approach is based on a set of weak learners that can be trained in parallel or sequentially (with slight modifications on the parameters) and used as an ensemble based on a majority vote or the averaging of results <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">22</ref> . These methods can be classified into two main categories: bagging (or bootstrap) and boost. In bagging, the ensemble is built completely. The training process is based on a random selection of the splits and the predictions are based on a majority vote. Random forests are an example of bagged tree ensembles. In boost, the ensemble is built sequentially, focusing on the samples that have been previously misclassified.</p><p>AdaBoost and gradient tree boosting are examples of boosted trees.  Transfer learning, where knowledge is shared between datasets and models, can be an effective tool for sparse and small datasets. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref>.9 shows the architecture for single task and architectures for transfer learning based on conventional machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">61</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Transfer learning</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref>.10 shows the architecture for the transfer learning technique based on convolutional neural network <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">63</ref> . The benefits of transfer learning include reducing training time, improving generalization with small datasets, sharing knowledge between related tasks, eliminating manual feature engineering. Machine learning was firstly designed and customized for its traditional application fields <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , e.g. recommendation system, computer vision, natural language processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Challenges in machine learning for materials research</head><p>However, the tasks in material science show different characteristics from typical machine learning applications. Thus, existing machine learning tools need adjustments to make it work in materials science. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">2</ref>.1 compared machine learning for its traditional applications and machine learning for materials from the points of data, descriptors, and tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1">Data-wise challenges</head><p>Big data is a phrase commonly associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Companies, e.g., Amazon, Google, Facebook, can quickly and cheaply gather big datasets of billions of samples. In materials science and engineering, the rate of generating data is very slow. In curation of material datasets, it is often completed by hand. The Materials algorithms project of Cambridge University, NIMS (Japan national institute for materials science) materials database provide dozens of materials datasets which are available only after decades of accumulation. Materials genome initiative (MGI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[66]</ref> , high-throughput computing <ref type="bibr">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[71]</ref> and material chips have increased the speed of generating data by dozens to hundreds of folds. However, it is still impossible to assemble big datasets like that in the internet and e-commerce. Thus, datasets in materials fields are often small (datasets usually have dozens of examples to several thousand of examples) for a specific task <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">73</ref> .</p><p>Machine learning applications, e.g., product recommendation and consumer behavior analysis, acquire records from structured sources like website analytics tools. Images and videos used in computer vision can easily transform file formats. Materials data come from different sources (e.g., test results, simulation data, handbook data, supplier datasheets) and in different formats (e.g., microstructure images, datasheets of composition/processing/properties, processing history records, spectrum). Thus, material datasets are often highly heterogeneous. Curating a reliable dataset from distinct data sources requires deep understanding and careful processing of the data.</p><p>Sample bias in datasets is common in materials science. Failed experiments and materials of poor properties are commonly discarded and cannot be accessed publicly.</p><p>The biased distribution of data is detrimental to the generalization of the built machine learning models without doubt.</p><p>The error and variation from processing and measurement are inevitable in material data.</p><p>How to take into account of their influence on the achieved models is a big challenge for researchers in applying machine learning to material problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2">Descriptor-wise challenges</head><p>With a set of suitable descriptors, conventional machine learning can perform very well even with small dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">74</ref> . However, the optimal set of descriptors for a specific job in material research is not out-of-shelf. It is selected by trails and errors and adding new pertinent descriptors is always be considered if models' performance is not met requirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">75</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.3">Task-wise challenges</head><p>Typical machine learning applications are tasks that are simple for humans but difficult to code explicitly, like speech recognition and image recognition. The tasks of material science and engineering are exploring the relationship between chemistry, processing, microstructure, properties, and performance; and to synthesis better materials by exploiting this knowledge. It is a task that is difficult for humans and hard to code explicitly. It demands prediction with high accuracy (even in extrapolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">77</ref> for materials scientists are more interested in developing materials of better performance)</p><p>and error estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[82]</ref> , models with interpretability 56,83-86 (a "black box" model cannot meet our requirements in the material field) and transferability. If a machine learning model cannot meet these requirements, its applications will be constrained.</p><p>Machine learning for materials science and engineering is more complicated than typical machine learning applications. It therefore requires a more sophisticated approach (special techniques and processes) at many points within the machine learning workflow.</p><p>In many typical machine learning applications, error estimation is not essential. For example, in the movies recommendation system, an error of 20% in prediction only means ±1 point difference in a 0-5 scale. This usually has little impact on audiences.</p><p>However, a 20% error in a prediction of material properties could mean the prediction is unreliable, and we need to carry out more costly experiments. Error estimation help researchers understand predictions and decide the next step actions.</p><p>3 Literature review on solidification cracking &amp; phase formation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Solidification cracking</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Hot cracking and solidification cracking</head><p>Hot cracking, which is also termed as hot tearing, hot shortness or hot brittleness, is one of the most severe defects formed at high temperature range in casting and welding, especially in Ni-based alloys and some Al-based alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">87</ref> . Hot cracking can be defined as material separations that occur at high temperature range (above half the melting point of alloys) along the grain boundaries (dendrite boundaries) when the local strain and the local strain rate attain critical values <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">88</ref> . Hot cracking can be subdivided into three easilyconfused types: solidification cracking, liquation cracking and ductility dip cracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[91]</ref> .</p><p>Ductility dip cracking is caused by reduced hot ductility of solid phase due to diffusion related compositional changes and precipitation of brittle secondary phases. Liquation cracking takes place in areas of liquation in heat-affected zone or in multi-pass welds.</p><p>Solidification cracking occurs in mush zone at the last stage of solidification. The fractography of solidification cracks exhibits dendrites characteristics. The solidification cracks can develop to be surface cracks or remain to be subsurface / internal cracks <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">89</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">The complexity of solidification cracking</head><p>Solidification crack, which widely occurs in casting, welding, and additive manufacturing, is a very serious defect for it cannot be healed through following processing e.g. rolling,</p><p>forging and heat treatment. It appears at the last stage of solidification when liquid films exist between dendrites boundaries and the local strains cannot been accommodated through liquid phase feeding and solid phase deformation. It is a complex phenomenon for material, mechanical, and thermal factors work together to incur the nucleation and propagation of cracks and these factors interact with each other, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_48">3</ref>.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">89</ref> . The weldability and castability of metallic materials are closely correlated with their solidification cracking susceptibility (SCS). The complexity and harmfulness of solidification cracking rationalize the existence of so many experimental techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">93</ref> , physical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[94]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[95]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[96]</ref> , and numerical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[97]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[98]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[99]</ref> . Solidification cracking tests are time-consuming and costly. Thus, only very few alloys and parts can be tested. The difficulty of direct in-situ observation of solidification cracking phenomena caused by high temperature and opaque metallic matrix determines that indirect measurements are the main approaches of studying solidification cracking. Theories about solidification cracking susceptibility based either on metallurgical features, or strain, or strain rate, or stress criteria are either over-simplified (no existing theory can take account of all factors mentioned before) or lack solid physical basis thus cannot work effectively in practice.</p><p>Complex numerical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">97</ref> , which simultaneously modeled thermal, fluid, mechanical fields and intergranular network geometry, only able to predict the most susceptible positions of solidification cracking but not the solidification cracking susceptibility of alloys.    but in fact it is not. The cause might be relative to their high degree of coherency.</p><p>(7) Surface tension Solidification cracking involves the separation of liquid film between grains, so surface tension <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">89</ref> plays a role in the process. Alloys of bad wettability (i.e. high interface energy 𝛾𝐿/S and bridge between grains is strong) and very good wettability (i.e. low interface energy 𝛾𝐿/S and back-filling ability is high) are not solidification cracking susceptible.</p><p>Alloys of medium wettability are solidification cracking susceptible.</p><p>(8) Grain boundaries Grain boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">87</ref> are the areas where solidification cracking takes place. So the characteristics of grain boundaries have an obvious influence on solidification cracking susceptibility. These characteristics include grain shape (i.e. columnar vs equiaxed grains), grain structure (i.e. primary austenite stainless steel owns more straight grain boundaries and worse weldability than primary ferrite stainless steel) and grain size (fine grain means more grain interface need to be separated in the crack propagation compared with coarse grain. Thus fine grain castings and welds are less solidification cracking susceptible).</p><p>(</p></div>

So, it is very reasonable to correlate porosity with solidification crack, inferring the porosity can be the nucleus of solidification cracks. On the other hand, the formation of porosity reduces macro shrinkage, thus decrease solidification strain and solidification cracking susceptibility.</p></div>

Commercial stainless steel commonly contains at least a dozen elements. Its major elements include Fe, Ni, Cr, Si, Mn, Mo; and its minor elements include C, N, P, S, Ti, Nb, B. The phases in stainless steel include matrix e.g., ferrite, austenite and martensite; and secondary phases e.g., carbides, nitrides, sulfides and phosphides.</p><p>Composition variation causes changes in solidification mode, solidification sequence, elements segregation and secondary phases precipitation.</p><p>Ferrite can accept more impurity elements (like S and P) than austenite. Irregular ferrite/austenite grain boundary is not in favor of the propagation of cracking cracks.</p><p>Thus, a High ratio of Cr to Ni (or Cr equivalent to Ni equivalent) is good for solidification cracking resistance by forming a certain amount of ferrite like that in AISI 301 and 304.</p><p>Fully austenitic stainless steels like AISI 316 is more susceptible to solidification cracking than stainless steels contain a certain amount of ferrite like AISI 304.</p><p>Impurity elements C, N, P and S, which tends to segregate to grains boundaries, increase cracking susceptibility.

The optimal support vector machine, shallow neural network and deep neural network were chosen to make predictions and comparisons.</p><p>All machine learning works were carried out in Matlab 2018a with its statistics and machine learning toolbox and neural network toolbox. Due to small dataset and pretraining, the time required to train one deep neural network configuration with one random seed on a personal computer (@2.6GHz processor, 16GB RAM) varied from several seconds to dozens of seconds, which is comparable with that of shallow neural network and support vector machine and is obviously shorter than that of training deep neural network for image recognition where many GPUs and many hours or even many days are needed. The training time for tree-based models were quite short (only several seconds) and can be neglected.   This is consistent with other researchers' results: when we increase the neuron number in the hidden layer, the training accuracy of a neural network easily reaches very a high score e.g., 0.99, but the testing accuracy has a limit. That is one of the main reasons why researchers explore the deep neural network, for higher testing accuracy, which represents the real learning ability (the training accuracy can be perceived as the memory ability). The best training accuracy of shallow neural networks is 0.99, and the best testing accuracy is 0.89.

This is not expected as deeper neural network should be more expressive and bring better performance according to the experience of deep neural network in image recognition, the possible cause of the behavior could be that the deep neural network structure is not optimal and the small dataset lacks enough training data to determine the optimal parameters of five hidden layers deep neural network.</p></div>

This further confirms that deep neural network has a higher generalization performance than shallow neural network and support vector machine.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8">Summary</head><p>Five machine learning models, i.e., shallow neural network, fully connected deep neural network, support vector machine, decision tree and random forest, were used to predict solidification cracking susceptibility of stainless steels as a function of composition and processing parameters. Fully connected deep neural network models (with pre-training and fine-tuning) outperformed shallow neural network, fully connected deep neural network models (without pre-training), support vector machine and tree-based models in prediction accuracy; tree-based models have accepted accuracy and better interpretability than support vector machine and neural network models; the optimal deep neural network has more compact structure and less parameters than the optimal shallow neural network (thus able to reduce the risk of overfitting and increase generalization).</p><p>Through machine learning regression, vast scattered experimental data hidden in literature can produce simple quantitative expression: specific material property as function of chemistry composition and processing parameters. The derived models can be used in material property prediction, new alloys development, and comparison with experimental results.</p><p>The combination of multiple machine learning models shows that solidification cracking susceptibility of stainless steels was mainly determined by Ni content / Cr content (or ferrite content / austenite content), impurity content and the value of applied strain.</p><p>Though deep neural networks plus big datasets are the best choice, deep neural networks with small datasets and pre-training can be a reasonable choice when big datasets are not available. In material science, small datasets are common, and the problems to be solved have fewer input variables than that in image recognition. Thus, compact deep neural network (neuron number in each hidden layer is small) are suitable for material problems, such as solidification cracking susceptibility prediction in this study, and pre-training using stacked auto-encoder is effective and necessary in the fully connected deep neural network regression of small datasets. Our study demonstrates that compact / narrow fully connected deep neural network with a small dataset and</p><p>special training methods has huge potential for extensive applications in material study, especially for those multivariate nonlinear problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Glass-forming ability dataset</head><p>Enough reliable data is vital for the performance of a machine learning model. In this work, we try to assemble a glass-forming ability dataset as large as possible. Our dataset includes Sun's binary alloys dataset 158 (about 3000 entries) and Ward's ternary amorphous ribbon alloys dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">58,</ref><ref type="bibr">159</ref> (about 6000 entries) and bulk metallic glasses dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">57</ref> (about 800 entries) and Miracle's dataset 177 (about 300 entries). In those datasets, crystalline alloys data are in the minority, because amorphous ribbon alloys and bulk metallic glasses are the focus of research, crystalline compositions are commonly discarded and unpublished as the failed experimental results. In reality, the number of amorphous alloys is less than that of their crystalline counterparts. To compensate for this weakness and increase the variety of crystalline data in our dataset, we add 800 pieces of conventional crystalline metallic materials data (including steels, superalloys and Co, Al, Mg, Cu, Zn alloys) from https://www.makeitfrom.com/ into our dataset. After sorting and removing redundancy, our dataset has 10440 entries. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">5</ref>.2 shows the statistics of our raw dataset. Our dataset contains 97 different elements in the periodic table, and many of these elements simultaneously present in entries of crystalline alloys (CR), amorphous ribbon alloys (AMR), and bulk metallic glasses (BMG).</p><p>The statistics of labels are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>.1. The distribution of elements and three labels is good for data division and model training.    Though the dataset is not small, taking into consideration of the myriad of elemental combinations and compositional variation (e.g., if elements A, B, C, D vary from 1 to 99 at% with 1at% compositional interval, there will be 4851 possible combinations in one ternary system A-B-C alone; there will be 156849 possible combinations in one quaternary system A-B-C-D alone), the deficiency and sparsity of the data is apparent.</p><p>Alloys in our dataset only occupy a tiny part of the possible combinations, i.e., most compositional space is unexplored. This can be seen as another form of small dataset and is common when applying machine learning models to material problems.   Materials science community has made a great effort in accumulating big datasets of materials properties: e.g. open quantum materials database (OQMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">68,</ref><ref type="bibr">178</ref> , automatic flow for materials discovery (AFLOWLIB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">70</ref> , the materials project <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">71</ref> , crystallography open database (COD) <ref type="bibr">179</ref> , Springer Materials (https://materials.springer.com/). These big datasets can be exploited as source datasets for transfer learning (just like the role of ImageNet dataset in computer vision field) to build the general and transferable feature extractors. In this work, we used a dataset of 228,676 compounds from OQMD which was also used by <ref type="bibr">Ward 58</ref> before. They are lowest-energy compounds at their unique compositions. The dataset involves these compounds' chemistry and their physical properties calculated by density functional theory (DFT). Convolutional neural networks are trained on the dataset to predict formation energy (Ef) and specific volume (V) of these compounds. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">5</ref>.4 shows the elements distribution in the OQMD dataset.</p></div>

To exploit the convenience of convolutional neural network's automatic features extraction, we mapped (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">5</ref>.5) the raw data to 2-D images (increasing data dimensional) using a modified periodical table representation (PTR).

In the training phase, the output of the shallow neural network and convolutional neural network fitted the ground truth, and the categorical cross-entropy was used as the loss function to evaluate the fitness. The maximum epoch was set to 2000 (loss values almost remain unchanged), and 10-fold cross-validation (so ten models were created after training) was used to evaluate the training/testing accuracy.

Four shallow neural networks (with 20 neurons in the hidden layer) using different feature vectors achieved the best accuracies were compared with convolutional neural networks. All models were trained on a laptop with 2.6 GHz i7 processor and 16 GB memory.

In the training phase, the output of the convolutional neural network fitted the ground truth, and the mean absolute error (MAE) was used as the loss function to evaluate the fitness. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.1">Training and testing results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>.6 shows the average training and testing accuracies of four shallow neural networks (SNNs) and three convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under 10-fold crossvalidation in predicting glass-forming ability. SNN1 (using only 14 features derived from empirical rules of metallic glass community) and SNN4 (using 145 general-purpose Magpie descriptors) show the lowest testing accuracy of about 90%. They show a marginal difference in accuracy with Ward's random forest model (89.9% vs. 90%). SNN4 and Ward's random forest model used 145 general-purpose Magpie features, and SNN1 only used 14 features (including one processing parameter, mixing entropy, the statistical information of atomic radius, Pauling electronegativity, bulk modulus, and work function). We found increasing features or even using the full list of features (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>.3) did not bring noticeable improvement in accuracy. SNN2 only used one-hot composition vector as input, but it showed higher accuracy than SNN1 and SNN4. SNN3 used manual features vector plus composition vector as input and it improved the accuracy further. Due to our limited understanding of glass-forming ability and lacking precise property data as input (e.g., ideal solution model and Miedema model were used to calculate alloy mixing entropy and mixing enthalpy, respectively), improving the model's accuracy by adding more pertinent features is impracticable. All four shallow neural networks show lower accuracies than three convolutional neural networks.</p><p>Besides convolutional neural networks' accuracy advantage over shallow neural networks, it is also quite convenient to use convolutional neural networks. They only need compositions and processing parameters as input, and they automatically extract features through convolutional layers. CNN3 which refers to a convolutional neural network with periodic table representation shows the highest testing accuracy of 96.3%.</p><p>The only difference among the three convolutional neural networks is in that the data representations of CNN1 and CNN2 did not have periodic table structure. The advantage of CNN3 over CNN2 and CNN1 is not evident (only 1.3% higher). However, we will demonstrate that CNN3 has more obvious advantages over other models in predicting unseen alloys, i.e. better generalization.   All models (except SNN4) correctly predicted the five bulk metallic glasses in the ground truth and the predicted bulk metallic glasses cover certain area (not some discrete points) around the ground truth points. It is reasonable, researchers commonly reported the optimal bulk metallic glasses only, and bulk metallic glasses candidates (especially before the discovery of bulk metallic glasses) are archived as amorphous ribbon alloys. This sparse and ununiform distribution of bulk metallic glasses data points usually induces bulk metallic glasses data points buried by surrounding densely distributed amorphous ribbon alloys points and omitted as a noise, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">5</ref>.11(a). That is why we adjusted the ternary classification into binary classification, i.e., ternary classification easily underestimates alloys' glass-forming ability.  To validate the predicting ability of models on unseen alloy systems, we carried out a leave-one-system-out (LOSO, like the leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation used by Meredig et al) <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">76</ref>         In summary, when dataset is large enough (e.g. the Al-Ni-Zr system), though the benefit of adding domain expertise to representation is not obvious, the advantage of automatic feature engineering over manual feature engineering is evident; when data is rare or no data is available, domain expertise is vital. Periodic table structure plus CNN, like CNN3, not only brings the convenience of automatic feature engineering but also improves the generalization by introducing background knowledge. mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting Ef is 0.083eV/atom and for predicting V is 0.457 Å 3 /atom, which is better than Ward's result <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">58</ref> (MAE is 0.088 eV/atom and 0.563 Å 3 /atom for Ef and V, respectively) using the same dataset with 145 Magpie manual features plus random forest model. The results show convolutional neural network regression not only eliminates the need for manual features engineering but also improve the testing accuracy (generalization). We believe that feature extractors of these convolutional neural networks can extract a rich set of features (which is the basis for next step transfer learning) as these convolutional neural networks have been well trained (testing accuracy can be as high as 0.99) on a big dataset involving 228k substances and 89 elements.       knowledge and make a reasonable inference.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Phase prototype dataset</head><p>We selected phase prototypes data from 'Handbook of inorganic substance 2016' 189 . The handbook which has phase prototypes of more than 160k inorganic substance, belongs to the well-known Pauling files project 190 . In the Pauling files project, a phase prototype (crystal structures) was specified in three parts: type-defining compound (e.g., 'Fe', 'ZnS'),</p><p>Pearson symbol (e.g., 'cF4', 'tP8') and space group number (1 to 230).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Visualization of the automatically-extracted features</head><p>Challenges in predicting phase prototypes based on composition include small sample volume (small dataset) for half prototypes in our dataset, imbalanced data distribution (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_115">6</ref>.4 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">6</ref>.1), and large number of categorical labels (170 labels in our work, as far as we know in the published works 172 researchers discriminated no more than ten structures in a machine learning task). Manual feature engineering plus conventional machine learning were considered at the beginning. However, our dataset involves a variety of inorganic substances, e.g. solid solution alloys, metal intermetallics, oxides, sulfide, halide. It is quite challenging to build features manually (which require a deep understanding of these substances). Furthermore, some physical data, e.g. atomic radius, bulk modulus used in manual features engineering is unavailable for some elements in our dataset which is difficult to fill reliably by hand. For these reasons, we resorted to transfer learning.</p><p>To gain insight into the extracted features and explaining why transfer learning is effective, we attempted to visualize features vectors generated by the transferable feature extractors and to find some patterns from these visualizations. However, uncovering the relationship visually and intuitively from these high dimensional features is quite challenging. There will be a 192*17,762 matrix (i.e. one substance has a 192dimensional feature vector) for our phase prototypes dataset, and it necessities a dimensionality reduction of these features. We compressed these high dimensional features data by principal component analysis (PCA). We visualized the first 4 principal components to (partially) represent the multi-principal element alloy knowledge yielded by the well-trained feature extractors on glass-forming ability dataset. We visualized the first 3 principal components to (partially) represent the phase prototypes knowledge yielded by the well-trained feature extractors on OQMD dataset. The features of 355 multi-principal element alloys generated by glass-forming ability model were shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_115">6</ref>.7. We can see that alloys of the same phases tend to cluster in the diagrams. Based on the first and second principal features, we can intuitively distinguish stable BCC, FCC, HCP and multi-phase alloys. Most alloys of metastable amorphous phases can be discriminated from other alloys of stable phases by the third and fourth principal features visually. It indicates transfer learning from glass-forming ability to multi-principal element alloys is successful and justifies the high scores of our model for multi-principal element alloys.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.2">Features analysis for phase prototypes</head><p>Because it is impossible to illustrate the knowledge of all 170 prototypes and over 17k substances in a figure (even impossible in many figures due to the nature of a large number of high-dimensional vectors), we choose a few phase prototypes (some common prototypes and some uncommon prototypes) to illustrate their distribution in   Inorganic substances are colored according to their phase prototypes. The percentage represents the ratio of the variance on the principal axis direction.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_115">6</ref>.8 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_115">6</ref>.9 show that only using three principal components, i.e., three automatic generated principal features, we can discriminate thousands of substances belonging to dozens of prototypes. It indicates transfer learning from predicting Ef and V using OQMD dataset to predicting phase prototypes is successful and justifies the high scores of our model for prediction of phase prototypes. It can be concluded that basis of good application of transfer learning in this case is the sharing of mutual features between two domains, one with a large dataset and other with a small dataset. The root of mutual features can be attributed to the fundamental laws of physics and chemistry that all inorganic substances follow (i.e., different materials have some features in common). So, some general and mutual features exist that can be used for describing them, which is the basis of transfer learning. We should bear in mind that we have 384 features in total. Excluding some irrelevant features (i.e., features only relevant to predicting forming energy Ef and specific volume V), the rest are common features and generally useful in new applications.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_46"><head>3. 1 . 3 ( 3 )</head><label>133</label><figDesc>Material factors(1) Solidification interval Solidification interval or solidification temperature range<ref type="bibr" target="#b167">89</ref> ΔT of an alloy is defined as ΔT=TL-TS or ΔT= TL-TEut, where TL is liquidus temperature, TS is solidus temperature (use eutectic temperature TEut instead in nonequilibrium solidification). Solidification cracking occurs during liquid transforming to solid. Impurity elements such as sulfur and phosphorus remarkably enlarge the solidification interval of Fe-based and Ni-based alloys by forming low melting point eutectics e.g. FeS-Fe (TEut = 985°C), Fe3P-Fe (TEut = 1050°C), NiS-Ni (TEut = 644°C), and Ni3P-Fe (TEut = 880°C). Thus, some researchers correlated solidification interval with solidification cracking susceptibility and proposed that solidification cracking susceptibility is in proportion to the solidification interval.However, many solidification cracking phenomena cannot be explained using this simple criterion, even use the solidification interval modified by Scheil model and back-diffusion model.(2) Vulnerable Region Clyne and Davies defined solidification cracking sensitivity (SCS)<ref type="bibr" target="#b165">87</ref> based on thermal analysis: SCS = 𝑡𝑣/𝑡𝑟, where 𝑡𝑣 is the vulnerable time period during which local strain in mush zone is difficult to be accommodated and cracks can easily propagate, and 𝑡𝑟 is the immune time period during which local stress and strain can be easily relaxed through liquid flow and solid deformation. The biggest problem of Clyne's solidification cracking sensitivity criterion is they simply choose (without much reason) 𝑡𝑣 and 𝑡𝑟 as: 𝑡𝑣 = 𝑡0.99-𝑡0.90 , 𝑡𝑟 = 𝑡0.90-𝑡0.40, where the subscript numbers represent the volume fraction of solid. Different researchers may choose different 𝑡𝑣 and 𝑡𝑟 region, to make prediction results fit experiment results better. Solidification cracking temperature range (SCTR) In varestraint test, the maximum crack distances (MCD) are quantified through imposing augmented strain on samples. If the cooling rate is tested by inserting a thermocouple into weld pool, a characteristic temperature range which is called solidification cracking temperature range (SCTR) 100 is defined as follow: SCTR=[Cooling rate]×[MCD/V], where V is the welding speed (m/s). SCTR is a useful parameter when comparing the relative weldability between different alloys. (4) Back-filling Solidification shrinkage causes shrinkage porosity 87 . Porosity is a favorable site for solidification cracking initiation. Back-filling can reduce solidification porosity and heal solidification cracks. Risers are designed in casting to mitigate or eliminate solidification cracks, and the weld pool in welding plays the same role. The back-filling ability is closely connected with solidification cracking susceptibility. The back-filling ability is determined by dendrite tortuosity, melt viscosity, interface energy between melt and solid, and solid fraction. (5) Dendrite coherency The difficulty of bridging or coalescence of dendrite arms during the last stage of solidification plays an important role in solidification cracking 101 .</figDesc></figure>

Two characteristic temperatures 102-104 , i.e. coherency temperature and rigidity temperature, separate the three phases. Coherency temperature is the temperature that dendrites begin to touch each other. Rigidity temperature is the temperature that dendrites begin to be able to withstand tensile stress. During coherency temperature and rigidity temperature, tensile stress in mush zone will induce liquid film rupturing and cracking.</figDesc></figure>

There are challenges in understanding the evolution of phases in multi-principal element alloys. Early work on multi-principal element alloys was mainly focused on 3-d transition metals. The so-called Cantor alloy containing FeCrMnNiCo showed high strength and high ductility over a wide range of temperatures. With the interest to develop super high temperature alloys (next generation superalloys), a few researchers focused their attention on refractory multi-principal element alloys containing Nb, Hf, W, Cr, Zr 163 . While many new equiatomic multi-principal element alloys have been investigated in the past decade, researchers now realized the need to develop nonequiatomic multi-principal element alloys (and with additions of minor elements) to improve various properties. New subclasses in multi-principal element (MPE) alloys such as eutectic MPE alloys, MPE superalloys, TWIP-and TRIP-type MPE steels, dual-phase MPEAs, light MPE alloys, and MPE oxides have been developed in recent years[164][165][166] .Researchers attempted to predict the phase formation in multi-principal element alloys through CALPHAD approaches165  . Thermo-Calc has built a new thermodynamic database TCHEA for multi-principal element alloys. Researchers also attempted to predict it through empirical criteria based on Hume-Rothery rules, thermodynamic parameters (e.g., enthalpy of mixing ΔHmix and entropy of mixing ΔSmix), topological parameters (e.g., δ parameter and mismatch entropy ΔSσ), Kinetic approach (viscosity), Pettifor map.</figDesc></figure>

All four models are built on chemistry compositions only. However, the accuracy advantage of models based on transfer learning over the model based on simple composition vector is obvious. When testing ratio is 0.1 (i.e. 90% of the dataset are for training and 10% of the dataset are hold out for testing), transfer learning model based on Vector Ef&amp;V can reach accuracy of 0.9, while non-transfer-learning model based on Vector comp only got accuracy of 0.54.The accuracy of transfer learning model is relatively insensitive to the test ratio. When the test ratio increases from 0.1 to 0.5 (i.e. the ratio of training dataset to entire dataset decreases from 0.9 to 0.5), the accuracy only decreases from 0.9 to 0.85. The insensitivity of transfer learning models to the size of training dataset indicates it has good generalization and suitable for small datasets. The accuracy differences between 3 transfer learning models are small (about 0.01 -0.03). The model based on Vector Ef&amp;V shows the highest accuracy because it can access features from both feature extractors.</figDesc></figure>

Due to the incompleteness of them in our dataset, we simplified the regression problem as a classification problem. Considering that we should not arbitrarily declare that all amorphous ribbon alloys in our dataset cannot form bulk metallic glasses, we did not simply treat it as a problem of (CR / AMR / BMG) ternary classification. We added a process parameter (0 represents rapid solidification melt-spun, and 100 represent copper mold casting of normal cooling rate) into this problem to convert the ternary classification problem into a problem of (AM / CR) binary classification. AM represents forming an amorphous state, and CR represents forming a crystalline state, see the matrix for transforming the original labels to the new labels in</p></note></figure>

Applying convolutional neural networks with enough data, the benefit of adding domain expertise (periodic table structure) to data representation is not obvious. However, domain expertise is vital if data is insufficient.Overfitting and low accuracy can be anticipated when applying convolutional neural network (that we used in glass-forming ability and OQMD prediction) to small datasets of multi-principal element alloys. In this scenario, we can resort to transfer learning to tackle the challenge of small datasets. In transfer learning, two correlated datasets, i.e., source dataset (usually a big/medium dataset) and target dataset (usually a small dataset) are assembled. The source dataset is used for the transferable feature extractor (the convolutional layers of a convolutional neural network). The feature extractor generates feature vectors for the target dataset. The feature vectors are then used for training shallow classifier/regressor, e.g., random forest, shallow neural network.</figDesc><table /><note><p>6 Applications</p></note></figure>

The features extractors can be directly used in many small new target datasets.Training new convolutional neural networks from scratch based on the new datasets is not necessary. Only new classifiers and regressors need to be built and trained. Our model without resorting to any manual features is capable of distinguishing BCC, FCC, HCP, amorphous, and multiple-phase mixture with 5-fold cross validation scores (accuracy, recall, precision and F1) over 94% after training and test. We should bear in mind that when labels' distribution is unbalanced like that of our multiprincipal element alloys data, achieving high recall, high precision and high accuracy at the same time is very difficult. We can see model transferred from CNN3 has the highest scores which indicates that periodic table representation is also beneficial for transfer learning. The proposed transfer learning model is an upgrade for conventional machine learning relying on manual feature engineering. It could serve as an effective guide for designing new multi-principal element alloys.</figDesc><table><row><cell>The two machine learning tasks, i.e. predicting glass-forming ability (GFA) and predicting</cell></row><row><cell>phases of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), have different output domain</cell></row><row><cell>(amorphous/crystalline binary classification in glass-forming ability prediction and 5</cell></row><row><cell>phases labels in multi-principal element alloys prediction) and highly correlated (or</cell></row><row><cell>overlapped) input domain from the point of transfer learning: Figure 5.2 and Figure 6.2(b)</cell></row><row><cell>atomic size difference, mixing enthalpy, mixing entropy, difference in Pauling</cell></row><row><cell>electronegativities, and valence electron concentration).

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_47"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>ConclusionsIn this thesis, three deep learning techniques (i.e., compact fully connected deep neural network plus pre-training, 2D periodic table data representation plus convolutional neural network, convolutional neural network plus transfer learning) were proposed to tackle the challenges in machine learning for materials research: small datasets and challenging manual feature engineering. Five case studies were carried out to validate their effectiveness: predicting solidification cracking susceptibility with a small dataset using compact fully connected deep neural network; predicting glass-forming ability and compound's forming energy and specific volume using periodic table representation plus convolutional neural network; predicting compound's phase prototype and phases of multi-principal element alloys through transfer learning with small datasets. The conclusions are shown as follows.Through machine learning, vast scattered experimental data hidden in literature can produce simple quantitative expression: material property as a function of chemistry composition and processing parameters.Though big dataset plus deep learning is an ideal solution, small dataset plus compact deep neural network and pre-training is a reasonable choice for small datasets are common in material research.Combination of deep neural network and tree-based models can bring us predictions of high accuracy and a certain insight of mechanisms.Mapping chemistry composition and processing parameters of materials to 2-D pseudoimages enables convolutional neural network process conventional structured data. This bypass the challenging manual feature engineering in machine learning. The feature extractors of convolutional neural networks that are well-trained on big datasets can be reused directly in new tasks to generate a rich set of general features. Transfer learning not only dramatically decreases training time of new models, but also improves accuracy and generalization of new models with small datasets.Convolutional neural networks get domain knowledge (e.g., periodic table knowledge) embedded in 2-D representation through learning. When dataset is large enough, the benefit of adding domain expertise to 2-D data representation is not apparent. However, domain expertise is vital for tasks of small datasets (limited data). Adding domain expertise to data representation improves models' generalization. Periodic table knowledge and is beneficial for the performance of convolutional neural networks and transfer learning models with limited data.</figDesc><table /><note><p>7.1</p></note></figure>

Periodic table has abundant physical and chemical knowledge (see Figure 5.15). Atomic radius, Pauli electronegativity, valence electrons density, and other physical chemistry properties display periodic variations in periodic table. When developing new amorphous alloys, periodic table is often used as a map; similar atom substitution and column substitution are common strategies for improving glass-forming ability. The spatial information or elements' relative position information is difficult to be fully described by manual features engineering (a 1-D vector). The solution is keeping the periodic table structure in representation. So, adding periodic table structure into data representations affords models the ability to infer useful information from the periodic table when direct data is insufficient.</p><p>To improve model interpretability and prove the benefit of using representations with periodic table structure, we illustrated the information convolutional neural networks extract from different representations.
